         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this Epiſtle I intend thee a little on theſe two Heads;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> An account of the Author, the occaſion of his writing this Book, and deſign therein, ſo far as my obſervation of him, or his information give me to know.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2)</hi> To ſay ſomewhat to thee becoming me to ſpeak as (my Name imports me to be) a zealous and ſincere lover of God and Chriſt, and of the whole Creation. And to <hi>Cuphophron</hi> in ſpecial, who though he mean very well, and hath true zeal for God, and always parts Friends with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb facs="tcp:101495:3"/>yet hath fire and air in him, which oft admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto unnatural heat and tempeſt; and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance enough to murmur about little things, like as the ſhallow Streams do in running through Pebbles. I ſhall perform theſe joyntly or promiſcuouſly.</p>
            <p>In the daily Viſits I make to this <hi>Philopolite,</hi> I found him one <hi>Monday</hi> after dinner ſomewhat penſive, and I being curious demanded the reaſon of it; to which he readily anſwered, <hi>That</hi> Cuphophron <hi>at a Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe that day reported, that one</hi> Melius Inquiren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum <hi>had by a</hi> New Contrivance <hi>mauled two great Doctors in our Church; ſo that one of them, he was ſure, had done ſpeaking, and the other being buried, alive or dead, he could not tell which, muſt appear no more.</hi> With what (I pray) was this done? <hi>Why? with the killing Tool, the</hi> Miſchief of Impoſitions; OR AN ANTIDOTE, <hi>(Mountebank-like in Capital letters, larger than any thing elſe on his Stage.)</hi> If this be all (I replied) <hi>Cuphophron</hi> was but in jeſt, or I'le warrant you no vancancy yet in the Deanary of St. <hi>Paul:</hi> and for the Other (who I know is moſt dear to thee) he mentions little hurt done him thereby, ſo that <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> is ſo ſound as a Bell still. This ſaid, we continued diſcourſing with mutual delight of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs and Charity, until time of Sleep parted us: when we lay down in peace, in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and wiſh of good to all; and went to our ſleep in confidence that our gracious God would give it to us, and alſo guard our reſting-place.</p>
            <p>Some days after, as I remember the firſt day of the next Week, the <hi>LORD's-day,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> calls it, becauſe thereon we ſhould piouſly and joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect what our Lord hath done for us, and what he
<pb facs="tcp:101495:3"/>will further do, if we would: Alſo to perform other acts of Worſhip, &amp;c. whereby we may ſhew to men, we do remember his Sabbath or Day to keep it holy. On that Day of joy it was I obſerved him dejected, ſo as if he had forgot what day it was.</p>
            <p>He prevented my Queſtion by the haſte he made to tell me the ground of his grief, thus;</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Though the two Doctors</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are ſafe, yet the Antidote will ſpoil us. The Author (I believe) doth not ſo intend; but unleſs ſpeedy care prevent, you</hi> (<hi>O</hi> Philotheus) <hi>will certainly be poyſoned for one, and all the</hi> Philopolites, <hi>and the Free Spirits will be expell'd the Kingdom thereby. For</hi> Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron <hi>himſelf, though he read only the Title, (and, as I think, ſcarcely that) is increaſed in heat, ſo that we are to be brain'd or to be begg'd into nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Circumſtances for Fools, if we receive not</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes <hi>as Victor Catholick, and Superlative at Text and Context. You, O</hi> Philotheus, <hi>by Precept and Example have taught me to</hi> Love my Country, <hi>I would thereſore prevent the miſery that is coming on it by the departure of</hi> Love. <hi>This Author, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any I have lately read, appears as a</hi> killer <hi>of it. You know it is little I can do, except Prayer to the Almighty, and if ever I do more, it ſhall not be as</hi> Diſputer, <hi>but as</hi> Propoſer, <hi>to what may</hi> heal <hi>or</hi> ſecure <hi>us without Blow or Conteſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I perceived by this, that the <hi>Philopolite</hi> had thoughts of doing ſomewhat; and finding his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and final Object no other than <hi>Charity,</hi> (though he was in an unuſual warmth to be doing) I did not diſſwade, leſt therein I ſhould be found reſiſting ought of God. For upon many natural accounts, as well as cuſtom in him, no man is, or ought to be, more
<pb facs="tcp:101495:4"/>averſe to writing than he. I left him therefore to his own inclination, and after we (together with his whole Family) had performed the last office of that holy Day, namely Prayer and giving of Thanks to God, in the Collects or Forms of Prayer and Praiſe our Church hath appointed, or in other good words extempore, (either of which, if we be hearty in them, are alike prevalent with him,) we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed a while how good it is to draw nigh unto God; how bleſſed they are that dwell in him and in his Houſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> that dwell in <hi>Love,</hi> and are still praiſing of him. We alſo reflected on our ſelves in all actions on that Day, and beholding the Face of God in Jeſus Chriſt, we had comfortable hope of peace in God through him; for that we found our ſelves in peace towards all men, and that we had ſincerely endeavoured to walk with our LORD during the whole of his Day. Which comfort of Hope was ever leſs in us, if at any time we loſt any part of that conſecrated time in Earthly or leſs holy Exerciſe, ſuch as is Chatt in Coffee-houſes about News, &amp;c. which is ſo far a loſing of time, in that it is (when leaſt) a not preferring a greater good in our practice. And when it is but for one day in Seven appointed by Chriſt or his Church to us, we cannot be ſuppoſed to need relaxation from them. Beſides, our own needs and the Spiritual wants of our Families, are ſuch as will take up the whole time; and it is ſo convenient for thoſe purpoſes, that it is a thouſand pities (as we ſay) ought ſhould be otherwiſe ſpent.</p>
            <p>By the end of the Week I perceived he had wrote well nigh all this Book, of which (at his requeſt) I am the Publiſher. In it thou wilt find
<pb facs="tcp:101495:4"/>(as I ever have found) him of no one Party of men amongſt us, nor driving thereunto; but following on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things which make for <hi>Peace,</hi> and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may <hi>edifie</hi> one another. Extremities are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable (and ſo always were) to him and me: I remember it is near (if not above) twenty ſix years ſince we laid up as a choice Jewel, what the Pious and Peaceable <hi>Joſ. Hall,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in his <hi>Soliloquies</hi> ſaith on the Extreams of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; towards the cloſe of which are theſe words, <q>
                  <hi>I thank thee, O God, that thou haſt given me a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to walk even between theſe Extremities: As I would be ever in a praying diſpoſition to thee, ſo I would not willing break hours with thee: I would neither ſleep nor wake without praying; but I would never pray without feeling. If my heart go not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with forms of words, I do not pray but babble, and if that be bent upon the matter of my Suits, it is all one to thee whether the words be my own or borrowed. Let thy good Spirit ever teach me to pray, and help me in praying, &amp;c. and then, if thou canſt, ſend me away empty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly in thoſe days we attended and uſed both the Forms and Extempore, as occaſion offered, or charity invited thereunto; declining all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Communions</hi> which did bar our being ſo <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is alſo one, who would have men leave off Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention before it be meddled with: And is (as you may ſee) troubled, that there are Contentions and Strivings amongst us about Ritual Obſervances: and a New-modelled Divinity, made up of fooliſh diſputings for purer Adminiſtration, to the neglect of, or treſpaſs upon the weighty matters of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb facs="tcp:101495:5"/>whereby men ſpend their time and zeal on Vanity or Vexation, <hi>i. e.</hi> on that which neither themſelves nor others are the better, but the worſe for.</p>
            <p>I hope neither ſide will perſiſt therein; for being they are in the moſt holy office,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.24.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to them, <hi>The Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men.</hi> If yet they ſhall go on, they will appear to be in that <hi>Snare</hi> of the Devil, as thoſe are <hi>who are taken captive by him at his will:</hi> And to future Generations will be ſigns or <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies, i. e.</hi> inſtructive to them, as that of <hi>Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> ſo horrid and diſmal, that they ſhall wiſh you never had been: or that you had been, as it were, <hi>Horn</hi> or <hi>Glaſs,</hi> (as the Antidote hath it,) <hi>i. e.</hi> any innocent or inſenſible thing, rather than to have had and to uſe ſo evilly the Noble power of Man.</p>
            <p>I have been Eye and Ear-witneſs of the Authors Loyalty to his King, and adhaeſion to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Charitable conformity thereunto, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than which he deems factious in the Body. His Loyalty hath been without any ſpot or blemiſh, except this, that in the heats of Zeal and Love to our preſent King and to his Father, he hath now and then gone too far in hating, as it were, thoſe who were too little for them, falling ſhort of that Pattern the Honourable and Loyal Lady ſet, who being told, The King would not like her feeding ſome of the Parliaments Army, (then ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger;) Replied to this effect, <hi>I had rather anſwer to my King for feeding, than to God for not feeding his and my Enemies.</hi> Alſo forgetting the Exhortation, which ſaith, <hi>Dearly Beloved, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge

               <hi>but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord. Therefore if thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink: Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> I call this a Spot in his Loyalty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a defect therein; one of the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees whereof, is our conformity to God and to the King, in that of a gracious nature, or a readineſs to do all good.

            <p>THough I am inclined to avoid all that will eaſily diſcover me the Author, yet I cannot let my Firſt-fruits paſs without an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Thanks to you, by annexing the mention of Your Favours to this Book, which in number and value are ſo great, as to make my whole ſelf a Debt to you. It is now near Eighteen years ſince I firſt knew You, during which time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Bond than that of <hi>Love</hi> You have been not only Fidelity, but Liberality and Bounty to me; obliging me by no leſs than the free gift of Your entire ſelf to me. Where, or however then I proceed, Your Beneſicence muſt be with me. Moreover, ſhould I have omitted You here, I had failed in the explicating and in the enforcing of Charity: For all that do, or that ſhall know You, will underſtand by what they ſee in You of the nature or offices of Love, and of Inducements thereunto, more than by
<pb facs="tcp:101495:8"/>what I can write or ſpeak; The Pious and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate proviſion You have made for ſome of Your Relatives, (which I hope You will in time make more publick) do evidence Your vigour in Divine and in Human Love: But nothing therein can out-do Your own temper and practice.</p>
            <p>I know You like not what I have ſaid, though leſs I could not ſay becauſe of Truth. I pray that Your diſpleaſure may ceaſe; for that it is the ſincerely intended expreſſion of that in me, which urgeth me towards You beyond what I can expreſs or conceive in Love. God diſpoſe and aſſiſt me to improve, as I may and ought, the advantage of having ſo good and ſo true a Friend: To whom I ſhall always expreſs,</p>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> The Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> at the time of Reformation from <hi>Romiſh</hi> Corruption.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2)</hi> The condition thereof ſince, to this day.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>(3)</hi> The Attempts for its Cure in the twenty years paſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>(4)</hi> The Maladies yet in it; and the moſt proper and effectual Remedies for cure of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. II. (1)</hi> The Church and State of <hi>England;</hi> when firſt Reformed, being fitted, joyned together and compacted, (as the Body of Man ordinarily is,) whereby the Head (as principal Member) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and the Veins and Arteries binding faſt the joynts, did afford ſupplies to every part, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the power or efficacy of the one, and the wants of the other, was, by the means of mutual Love and Charity, in diſpoſiton and way to attain
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101495:9"/>full Age, as it were, and Stature, ſuch as uſes to have full light and life, beauty and ſtrength, repute and happineſs belonging to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. III. (2)</hi> The condition of it ſince. Lapſed Man being eaſily ſeduced, and we being of too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant and mutable temper; <hi>Satan</hi> alſo having right of claim given him, (upon Sin committed by us,) accuſed us before GOD, and required that he might have the ſifting, or the ſhaking of us; <hi>i e.</hi> liberty to do his worſt to divide and destroy us. Permiſſion being given; He, by the infirmities of the Good, and by the dexterity in deceit of the Bad then amongſt us, ſoon effected our Fall, a very diſmal and Heart-breaking Fall; <hi>(1)</hi> In Church, and <hi>(2)</hi> In the Civil State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. IV. (1)</hi> The Church, he ſmote with <hi>ſore Boils,</hi> and with <hi>putrifying Sores;</hi> ſo that we did both grieve and infect each other.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> They who thought themſelves moſt distant to change, and ſure adherers to the Body, became firſt factious therein, by declining in <hi>Love,</hi> and by giving unto minute things (ſuch as Shoulder-knot of Ribband) the name and ſanction of <hi>Baſis</hi> for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion: whereas it was mutual Love and Charity, which compacted them at firſt, and by their means only were they to ſubſiſt and grow.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2)</hi> They who were then for farther <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſuffering Love to cool in them, and growing hot in zeal for things, (by far) leſs deſiring it then Peace or Charity, ſoon proceeded to Schiſmatical <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> By declining mental and local. Communion with the Body.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101495:9"/>
               <hi>(2)</hi> By framing new Churches and Covenants for purer Communion and Administration; forgetting the <hi>truth</hi> is to be ſpoken in <hi>Love,</hi> that the Church may be ſanctified and may grow thereby; alſo that no fellowſhip or adminiſtration availeth ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: For the Body can only <hi>edifie</hi> it ſelf in <hi>Love, Eph. 4.15, 16.</hi> an adhering to leſs pure adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Charity, will profit us, and will pleaſe God more, than purer, gained with hazard or loſs of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. V. (2)</hi> The Civil State by like means (as aforeſaid) was ſmote, ſo that the <hi>whole head was ſick, and the whole heart faint; from the ſole of the foot even unto the head there was unſoundneſs in it, wounds and bruiſes and putrifying ſores.</hi> And this for many years before and ſince the Years <hi>40, 41, 42,</hi> or <hi>48.</hi> (ſo much now mentioned) as Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collections, and other Hiſtorians tell us; <q>
                  <hi>We were no way cloſed, bound up, or mollified with Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until his Majeſties happy Reſtauration in</hi> Anno <hi>1660.</hi>
               </q> By which our wounds, in Civils, were healed; for with him was reſtored our <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Conſtitution,</hi> a Conſtitution ſo perfect and happy, that a better is not, (nor, I think, need not be) in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe for King or People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. VI. And</hi> (now) <hi>after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs, ſeeing that our God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deſerve, and hath given us ſuch deliverance as this; ſhould we again break his Commandments, and joyn in affinity with People of thoſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Would not the Lord be angry with us, till he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101495:10"/>hath conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant nor eſcaping?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have tranſcribed the Text almoſt verbatim, as in the Bible; on purpoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> To fix in your memory and heart, the great mercy of God in reſtoring to us our King, and our ancient Government in Civils.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2)</hi> To awaken both King and People unto ſerious reflection, how ſince to this day it hath ſtood betwixt God and us, with reſpect to his Commandments, and our joyning affinity with People of thoſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. The former every one may know, <hi>for the word is very nigh them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30.14. Acts 17.24.</note> by which they may diſcern how they have either broken, or obeyed the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>In the latter, by Abominations, I mean the evil Principles and Practices with which our State was ſo ſorely afflicted and corrupted, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>By People of thoſe Abominations, I mean thoſe now with us, who are in temper, principle or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <hi>like</hi> to them, <hi>heretofore,</hi> by whom we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>By joyning Affinity with them, I intend, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Counſel, and conſenting to Attempts and Plots for execution thereof.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch be in Neighbour Nations, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affinity with them, I intend, Correſpondencies, Leagues, and all Aſſiſtances whatſoever, whereby they are enabled to make havock or deſtruction on God's Creation, to overthrow or change Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to invade or raviſh the Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of their Neighbours. Let us then, by the Occurrences ſince <hi>60</hi> to this day, try how near we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101495:10"/>have been allied to People of theſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon an impartial and ſerious ſearch I doubt it will appear, that upon ſome great Sins of ours, that for one (it may be) of not <hi>improving</hi> unto mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> the Opportunity given us at his Majeſties firſt Return to us, whereby we might have been fitted, joyned together, compacted, and in growing towards perfection, as you have heard: I ſay, for this and other ſins committed by us, the Devil having gained leave to <hi>ſift</hi> us, hath ſhaken again our late restored Constitution, that I fear it will fall into perdition; ſo that there will be no remnant nor eſcaping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. VII. (3)</hi> The Attempts made the <hi>20</hi> years laſt paſt to heal us: wherein I find,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> Some of excellent tendancy thereunto. Of theſe moſt eſpecially were His Majesties gracious <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Delarations</hi> from <hi>Breda;</hi> his <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> for a Treaty at the <hi>Savoy;</hi> and his <hi>Declaration</hi> about <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh them wrote in letters of Gold for future Ages, and that the preſent Neglecters (who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are deſpiſers) of them, may ſee, repent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thereby. For ſo it is, nothing yet done proves effectual to our Cure.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2)</hi> Others in their attempts to heal, (as I would hope,) have hurt afreſh or opened; but have no way tended to cloſe our wounds.</p>
            <p>Whether any late made Laws in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> do ſo, is no Inquiry for me: His Majeſty ſingle, or (where he is greateſt) in Parliament, may inſpect and remove, when, and as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101495:11"/>
What Subjects therein have done, may (as I think) be conſidered by me. In them I find,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Partiality</hi> in ſome, <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> in others, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Charity</hi> in most.</p>
            <p>I will inſtance a few in Church and State.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1)</hi> In the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>attempts</hi> the miſchief of <hi>Separation,</hi> and <hi>omits</hi> that of <hi>Impoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>ſtrikes</hi> at the miſchief of <hi>Impoſition,</hi> and ſtrokes that of <hi>Separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One appears (as he ſaith) for <hi>Union,</hi> with mouth opening, <hi>Curſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Meroz;</hi> as if he would kill and ſlay all fleſh but his own, for <hi>Unity</hi> ſake.</p>
            <p>Another ſets forth the <hi>Plotters Doom,</hi> as a Son of the Church, the more effectually to wound his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this laſt I intend only a part of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the other being very uſeful.</p>
            <p>All of them I find <hi>defective</hi> in Charity, writing (as one would think) to ſcourge or vex, rather than to amend their Brethren; rather to enlarge than leſſen our diſtances. They are Schiſmatically and factiouſly for the Church, forgetting (as I ſaid) that truth must be ſpoken in Love.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2)</hi> In the <hi>State.</hi> It may not be convenient for me to repreſent the blame-worthy, or defective at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts herein. The beſt of the Attempts are thoſe which comport with and ſtrengthen His Majeſties frequent and gracious <hi>Aſſurances</hi> of Ruling accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Whether within <hi>20</hi> years paſt any alteration hath been made therein, I do not enquire. True <hi>Old Engliſh</hi> looks ſo lovely, that I turn me from <hi>New</hi> things, as moſt deforming; and as a return thereunto, ſo the corroborating of it, is moſt <hi>ſanative</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101495:11"/>to King and People. <hi>Remove not the Ancient Bound,</hi> is the advice of the King of Kings by <hi>Solomon, Prov. 22.28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any change herein will not only deface, but well nigh kill us: for to propoſe <hi>exalting</hi> a Political Head ſo, as not to be a Member of the Body Politick, is (as it would be in the Natural) to ſet a man's Head (that Collar may not touch Chin) ſome inches from his Neck. And to propoſe the other way, would be as edifying and comly, as to pull the Neck awry, and to crook the Body, ſo that ſome parts of the Hunch'd-back may level with the Head.</p>
            <p>We all know who look one way whilſt they row the other. I wiſh they were as much expoſed, who (among us) put a Crowned-Head too high for his Body, on deſign to out him quite, or to bring us again to Hunch'd-back level.</p>
            <p>Theſe, or any other <hi>departure</hi> from <hi>Old Engliſh,</hi> be it exceſs or defection, are againſt the interest and grain, as of an ingenuous and generous People, ſo of the moſt noble and true Prince. Therefore <hi>Counſellors thereunto</hi> ought to be treated as Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of Princes, and Traytors to Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>They who <hi>wiſh</hi> a King hated or depoſed, are prone to give him <hi>ſuch Advice:</hi> For not daring to Poyſon or Stab, they contrive this way to bring him to Self-murther; and let their ſtation in his Kingdom, their relation to him, or their pretences point never ſo fair to the contrary, yet do they at heart wiſh themſelves and his Kingdoms rid of him.</p>
            <p>Never any Kings in <hi>England</hi> periſhed by fury of the People, but by the Treaſon or Flattery of ſuch as did either in deſire or fact ſucceed them: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any Motive urging ſo forcibly the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101495:12"/>Death of our late King, as Fear, lest the People ſhould ſtir in his quarrel.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Monarchies</hi> (ſaith the incomparable Lord <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>) <hi>need not to fear any curbing of their Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs by mighty Subjects, ſo long as by wiſdom they keep the hearts of the People, who will be ſure to come in on their ſide.</hi>

            <p>That things in this Day, wherein others abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly diſcourſe of Perſons, may have their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, I have treated chiefly of them in this Book. The Reaſon of them appeared of force, ſo that I could not do other than advance them, as I do (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) above Perſons; by which I mean no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101495:13"/>men, but Perſons, as ſuch, in way of Argument. It is unhappineſs, but no Crime in me, (becauſe my will is not) to err or to diſpleaſe herein. By Perſons, by Evil Counſellors and their removes, (oft-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) I intend not any particular (as I have ſaid,) much leſs them who be impeached, or impriſoned for Treaſon, &amp;c. they I deem removed.

               <p>Man being (as Reaſonable ſo) Created, as appears in that he once was not, but was made, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by another; is bound to know, to obey and love his Maker and Preſerver, as his Owner, Ruler, and Benefactor.</p>
               <p>Man reflecting on himſelf, &amp;c. will ſee his Maker is GOD, as the generality and beſt of his kind have ever done.</p>
               <p>This God being the firſt and Supream good, the <hi>Idea</hi> of all abſolute perfection and bleſſedneſs, is moſt eſſential to the Notion of him.

               <p>What in this Section I have ſaid of <hi>Man,</hi> is alſo to be extended to <hi>Human Society, i. e.</hi> to Man in every of his Relatives: for as man's Naturals are by the Creation of God, ſo all his acquiſitions are by his Providence. Therefore in all that is his (came he to it naturally or providentially,) he is conſtantly to proceed in dependance on God, and ſo as to be ſubſervient and ſubject in all things to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101495:14"/>
Alſo, what I ſaid in the fore-going Section, is to be applied to the higheſt Singular, and to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Collective Body, if Humane. <hi>

               <p>Come we next to the moſt holy Oracles, which we call the <hi>Scriptures of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they declare yet more fully the ſame things.

               <p>What is ſaid in the next preceding Section, equally concerns Societies of Men, their Being, their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Happineſs, as alſo God's right to them, is the ſame, which I would evidence, if I could think it were doubted by any, who grant it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a ſingle man. One main deſign of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, was to bring Societies and Kingdoms unto his Father. He ſends forth <hi>his Twelve,</hi> St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. directs them unto houſes, and declares to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that having called him, <hi>Salvation</hi> was come unto <hi>his houſe.</hi> He Commiſſionates his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. to <hi>go and teach all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. i.e.</hi> to mark them out for his, and bring them to Covenant ſo to be.</p>
               <p>One Reaſon (as ſome have thought) of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> being to the Males only, was, becauſe of them were the Heads of Tribes and Families to be; and in the Apoſtles adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> where the Governour was baptized, his Houſe is baptized with him. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> is expreſs, that the Goſpel's deſign is to make <hi>a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People, &amp;c.</hi> Chap. 2.9. of his firſt Epiſtle. Many Duties are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which cannot be performed but in Society: And ſo great a part of the Scripture is either Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Prohibition, Promiſe, Threatning, Form of Prayer or Praiſe, or Example, &amp;c. bearing relation to men in Society; as puts it paſt doubt, that no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man is more obliged to be the Lord's than they, as alſo, that God is moſt deſirous they would be his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101495:16"/>
Theſe holy Oracles largely repreſent the ſorts, and frequently inculcate the practice of thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Duties, our Humanity obligeth us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to others: Such as to <hi>obey Magiſtrates; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> (Natural and Civil) not to <hi>provoke their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> to have Natural affection to them, to deal <hi>bona fide</hi> with them, to make proviſion for them; to be kindly affectionate one to another; to be pitiful, and courteous, and merciful; to render a reaſon, when out Faith or Practice is queſtioned, &amp;c. to propoſe fairly unto mutual conſideration matters of greateſt advantage to each other, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear we treat each other like Men, and propoſe for Common good. Thus the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as common Doctors of the World, propoſed, to all, things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and manifeſt of themſelves, that every one might by bare reading learn them, and ſee their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to obſerve them in their conduciveneſs to Common benefit.</p>
               <p>I will mention, as inſtance, two Precepts given by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> the one to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to them, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>And that ye ſtudy</hi> (or contend) <hi>to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs.</hi> The other is that to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to them, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Let all your things be done in Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Precepts are, as moſt Catholick in extent and obligation, ſo moſt reaſonable and moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in their nature.</p>

               <p n="2">(2) The now <hi>Revived Conteſt</hi> betwixt Conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and Non-conformiſts in Church matters, which, I fear, will (if not ſo deſigned by ſome,) ſtrengthen the former, or give being to another <hi>Plot</hi> in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>If what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (as I hear) hath ſaid, be true, that <hi>the Devil hath ſtirred up this ſtrife,</hi> it concerns them ſo to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> that both may fly from them.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> though I fear it will not.</p>
               <p>I rarely read either of their Diſputations, becauſe I am very well ſatisfied that the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Separations</hi> of the other, are <hi>miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> things: yet being by fame and importunity brought to an <hi>Antidote,</hi> ſo entituled, againſt a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I had lately (becauſe of ill words given it) read: I find one of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Novices</hi> ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Diſpute, and ſo lifted up, that I doubt he will fall, and pluck others with him (being they are Admirers of him) into the ſtate of deadly Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101495:18"/>
I find this <hi>Antidote</hi> hath the needful loud praiſe for wit and argument; ſo hath <hi>Melius Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum;</hi> but whether ſo needful, I know not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have not read it. Somewhat like a farther or better Inquiry, I meet with, as <hi>Leaf-gold,</hi> cloſing up this Antidote. The whole is very precious, ſo (if he pleaſe) he may call it <hi>Optimum Inquirendum.</hi> It begins at <hi>page</hi> 100.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus have I at length rubb'd through the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author's Diſcourſe; and upon a calm reflection on my work, do not think I can diſpleaſe any one more than my ſelf: Such is the common fate of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Diſputants, that whilſt they would reach a knock at their Antagonists, they loſe their blow, and wound themſelves. So eaſie it is, while we are Scribling, to forget that we are dying; and that our Sand runs faſter than our Ink: If the late</hi> change <hi>of Ink-horns</hi> into <hi>Ink-glaſſes, had but</hi> taught <hi>us how frail and brittle we all are, it had been the moſt innocent ſignificant ceremony that ever was invented.</hi> Theſe are his words.</p>
               <p>Now that you may ſee how he deals with other men, rather than to ſuggeſt his intent in them, I remark thereon thus: You ſee, Sirs, after that <hi>Ink</hi> on 99 Pages, and one large <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to Sir <hi>T. R.</hi> had obliterated the Old as miſchievous; he conſtitutes the <hi>Glaſs</hi> a new <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and it being once <hi>Horn,</hi> but lately changed into <hi>Glaſs,</hi> is become very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and the moſt <hi>Innocent ſignificant</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ever was invented.</p>
               <p>He doth not (I confeſs) impoſe it; yet ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly is it propoſed, that I gueſs his Flock and Admirers may receive and uſe it as ſuch from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101495:19"/>
For, (1) It is the moſt innocent ſignificant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that ever was invented, <hi>he ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) It is not of mens invention, being his own peculiar, every other man will ſay.</p>
               <p>His own, did I ſay? Was he in the Body or out of it, I cannot tell; but this I find he was <hi>upon a calm reflection:</hi> out (or moſt diſpleaſed) with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by a <hi>wound</hi> Own-ſelf had given him (occaſioned by being more eager and leſs skilful at Sharps than his Antagoniſt was) put into thought of dying.</p>
               <p>I find him alſo in freſh remembrance, (if not in ſight) of ſo great a Miracle, as is ſaid to be in <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> no leſs than <hi>the change of Ink-horns into Ink-glaſſes;</hi> which change was in deſign, or (when leaſt had) aptitude to teach us great parts of Religion: ſuch as that, to know our ſelves, <hi>i.e.</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>how frail and brittle we all are.</hi> He might have added as well, <hi>to know God, his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> ſince we are tranſparent (like <hi>Glaſs</hi>) in his ſight: and ſo from truth to truth, and from duty to duty, even ſo far as fancy can make Glaſs to go.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ink</hi> having no ſhare in the Miracle, he pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently omits ſuggeſting inſtruction thence; elſe, as red, or black, or both, it might have yielded much, as he (I preſume) knows hath been experimented heretofore.</p>
               <p>Now a moſt <hi>Innocent ſignificant Ceremony,</hi> founded on a miraculous Change, and as ſuch ſeriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by an oppoſer of Human Inventions, Carnal Ordinances, and the beggerly rudiments of this world; and being, as it were, <hi>Leaf-gold</hi> on <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote;</hi> what fleſh alive can reſiſt it? The upper and lower Tier of Cannon in Ship Sovereign, can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101495:19"/>never kill and ſlay like <hi>this:</hi> it ſo far pierceth me, that I cannot call it Human, becauſe ſo without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or wit. I wiſh his Flock and Admirers receive it not as <hi>Divine,</hi> thereby making their laſt errour worſe than their firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> receiving that for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi> which is none, becauſe it hath leſs Religion and leſs Reaſon, (ſo far as it juſtifies what the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor oppoſeth, <hi>viz. Separation,</hi>) and more venom (by far) than the Sermon.</p>
               <p>Both <hi>Sermon</hi> and <hi>Antidote,</hi> leave me leſs in love with Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Impoſitions</hi> and <hi>Separations;</hi> ſo I will not wifely, or unwiſely, offer ought in favour of either. But with the <hi>Antidoter</hi>'s leave, I will put two Caſes, which I hope may prove more edifying. I will leave the Knight wholly his own, but will preſume to uſe <hi>T. R.</hi> to nominate two <hi>Elect Ladies,</hi> equally ſuch as St. <hi>John</hi> ſent his ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle unto: in love and holineſs Catholick, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, and moſt worthy the Communion of Saints in every of God's Ordinances.</p>
               <p>(The Caſe of Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> is only ſuppoſed; for I have not heard, that any Conformiſt hath, in fact, been ſo rigid as the Caſe mentioneth him to be.)</p>

                  <hi>MIſtreſs</hi> T. <hi>cometh to a Conforming Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and addreſſeth to him thus:</hi> Sir, I am a lover of God and Man: Jeſus Chriſt, with all his Members, are precious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101495:20"/>to me. I would approach unto and obey the one in all his Ordinances. I would manifeſt my love to the other, and be ſo with them, that we may be as one in remembring, loving and praiſing our deareſt Lord, for his love in life and death to us.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Sir, permit me to receive, Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, the Body and Blood of my Saviour; by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread and drinking Wine, (as he ordained) with you on your next Commanion-day.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, I muſt tell you, I do ſometime communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with Chriſtians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here Non-conformiſts; and this I do not becauſe they are in Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but becauſe they are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And though I will joyn heartily with you in your form of Prayer and Praiſe to God; yet I deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the Primitive, namely, Feſtival poſture, that being moſt ſuitable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101495:20"/>to Praiſe or Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Beſide, I would ſave an Appeal to the <hi>Canon,</hi> if any charge my kneeling with adoring Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom, I preſume, the Doctor replies to this effect:</hi> I would give you, Sacramentally, the Body and Blood of our Lord; becauſe he gave them both in dying for thee, I would eat and drink with thee at his Table.</p>
               <p>We Chriſtians are One Bread, and you being Chriſt's true Diſciple, I have no terms, in God's name, to put upon you, as a Miniſter of Christ I receive every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p>But being in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Laws and Oath to keep to that poſture of kneeling, (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as uſed in our Church, you may do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin,) I must deſire you to forbear coming, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſs you will ſo Receive.</p>

                  <hi>MIſtreſs</hi> R. <hi>cometh to Mr.</hi> Alſop <hi>at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, <hi>being a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Preacher, and addreſſeth in terms the ſame, or like, with what Mrs.</hi> T. <hi>uſeth to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101495:20"/>craving to receive with him on his next Communion-day; and farther ſaith:</hi> But I muſt tell you, we having a very Holy Man for our Pariſh Miniſter; and one whom my Husband (though put out for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity) did, with many other Chriſtians, deem given to us as a Return of Prayer. With whom my Husband (when living) did himſelf joyn, and to it ever adviſed me. This Miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo very moderate and indulgent to me, I ſhall now and then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Preaching, and alſo Receive with him.</p>
               <p>This I do not, becauſe he conforms to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but becauſe he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and doth nothing in Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, but what I may be preſent at with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin.</p>
               <p>Farther I thus do, becauſe (as I think) I cannot totally ſeparate and be innocent: I Pray
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101495:20"/>therefore, becauſe I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem your Perſon and Miniſtry; let me break Bread with you on your next Communion-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom, I preſume, Mr.</hi> Alſop <hi>returns to this effect:</hi> I believe you are Chriſt's true Diſciple; that you love him, and that he loveth you; alſo that he died for you.</p>
               <p>But I will not give you, Sacramentally, his precious Body and Blood, unleſs by a Promiſe, or otherwiſe, you bind your ſelf never to receive this Sacrament from your Pariſh Miniſter, or with thoſe who Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate with him.</p>
               <p>So that unleſs you will therein totally ſeparate from them, I deſire you to forbear coming, with me.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101495:21"/>
In both theſe Caſes there is, I confeſs, a <hi>miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Impoſition.</hi> But where <hi>Guilt</hi> is, let any man judge; the Doctor, a Conformiſt, cannot admit Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> becauſe the Law of the Land, &amp;c. forbids. But Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi> denies Mrs. <hi>R.</hi> without warrant from God or Man.</p>
               <p>The Prudence and Charity of our Governours, will in time (as I hope) take away one: And others alſo may in time learn Chriſt better, than to lay ſuch yokes on his Diſciples, which cannot, becauſe ought not to be born.

               <p n="1">(1) Knowledge of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Incommunicable</hi> and <hi>Communicable perfections</hi> of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; alſo a being fixt in belief of the reality and excellency of his <hi>Being.</hi> And though Unity be neceſſary thereto, yet that there are <hi>Three</hi> ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein; which doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is not ſo myſterious, as I once took it to be: and to the pure and humble Inquirer after God, will be found that which renders Chriſtian Religion the more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and worthy of all acceptation, in that it gives light and beauty to all other parts of that <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>Socinian</hi> then, by denying this, ſhews himſelf a falſe pretender to Reaſon, having it not in truth; if he hath any, it is ſo groſs and material, that it exceeds not the Animal State or Life among men, when he meddleth with Divine Myſteries. But to return: The knowledge of God in himſelf, as I have ſaid, is a requiſite hereunto; ſo is that, what he is to us, and to the Societies of men.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Another requiſite, is to know <hi>Our ſelves; i.e.</hi> to know what we are, or have, with reſpect to our own Nation; <hi>i.e.</hi> as we are Men and Chriſtians, now living in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That you may ſee in ſhort what this knowledge of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Our ſelves</hi> is, I will preſent the Heads thereof to your view in this order.</p>

Whoever conſiders theſe Heads of <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> will ſee, that the ſtate of Man, either ſingle, or in Society, is a ſtate of ſubjection to God, and to eternal Right or Truth. That he is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Creature, and that his excellency is not Bodily, but Mental; he ought therefore to reverence himſelf, and not live or move as if only Brutiſh. He will alſo find that Man hath a Negotiating or active Spirit in him; it then concerns him to take heed that he be doing his own Buſineſs: For the Actions of Men are under conſtant obſervation, as will be obvious to any who beholds the <hi>Face of God</hi> in the account I have given of him. We may therein alſo ſee one part of our own Buſineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be Humane in our treating of one another: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God appears, not to diſpoſe of Man by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Will, but by Law. When God doth limit us by his Laws, he doth in a ſenſe, as it were, limit himſelf: For as he by them bounds our Actions, ſo by them he bounds his own Judgment of us. We muſt diſtinguiſh Decrees and Judicial proceedings in God: the former being matter of Favour, he may act therein by abſolute Will; but the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of Right, his Perfection and his goings forth into Laws, are (if I may ſo ſpeak) limits to him. We by them diſcern one good ground of Joy in the worſt of Times, namely, that this World is not without a Ruler; though we ſee him not, yet the <hi>Lord reigneth;</hi> He, whoſe Judgments and Rules are unerringly laid. It is a comforting and a heart-fixing Conſideration, that there is no change in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Governours, but what is ordered or underſtood by the Supream Ruler, who never changeth, and who ever is Good-will to Men.</p>

Again, Never to charge God with Man's Sin; but condemn him whoſe behaviour was unworthy to God, and cruel to himſelf. Alſo, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his ſad and lamentable condition, from which he is not able to deliver himſelf, nor once to have a deſire, and to look out for help elſewhere to be had. Theſe we are directed and obliged unto by the knowledge of our eſtate, as lapſed. Laſtly, To own Chriſt's Doctrine; to obey his Laws; to tranſact with God, and to expect from him, all through the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101495:28"/>Mediator. To ſee the evil of Sin, and the Love of Chriſt crucified, &amp;c. To love him, <hi>who died, &amp;c. for us:</hi> To underſtand the ends of his Death, and to deſire to enjoy them: With abundance more, (too many in ſo ſmall a Book to be mentioned,) are evidenced to be our work, by the account I have given of Man Reſtored.</p>
               <p>Further, the Analyſis expreſſeth knowledge requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make Man <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>univerſally Good;</hi> than which nothing can be more his Buſineſs, or be more conducive to the proſperity of Nations.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, Theſe give us the knowledge, which will lead us into the next ſort I am to ſpeak to, and will help us therein, namely,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>The knowledge of the whole Duty of Man:</hi> For when we ſee who, and where we are, the next requiſite is to know what we are then to do. When we find where we are, <hi>i.e.</hi> how we ſtand in, and are qualified for the State or Church, by the fore-going Information; then to know what we are bound to do therein, is very uſeful Knowledge. And as to know all our Duty, ſo to ſee them in the natural or inſtituted Order of performance is moſt requiſite likewiſe; becauſe two may appear at once, when but one can be done by us. And we ſhall be at a loſs to know, which at that time is our <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> i.e. which is moſt fit to be done then by us.</p>

I am no <hi>Papist,</hi> to wiſh or contrive his death; nor <hi>Rat-Catcher,</hi> to ſuggeſt that Snares and —bane are good for him: Nor yet am I a <hi>Republican-Wreſtler,</hi> in a deſign to trip up his heels, that he may be level with me.

               <p>I remember the ſorrow I felt for the Murther of his Father, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. (though I was then not above 12 years old,) and the diſtraction and miſery ſince.

               <p n="1">(1) Let Governours then in Civils do their own buſineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> adhere unto <hi>true Old Engliſh:</hi> look, when and wherein we have thence departed. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the horrid Plot may bear <hi>date</hi> with it: if ſo, nothing ſo Sovereign to King and Peoples ſafety as to return, and by good Laws effectually enforced, ſecure our Conſtitution from future Tyranny, as well as preſent Sedition.</p>

And becauſe Evil Workers may improve the <hi>eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>goodneſs</hi> in a Proteſtant, as they will the <hi>heady Obstinacy</hi> of a Papiſt, to greateſt Tyranny and Oppreſſion: Alſo, becauſe bare Opinion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (as ſome think) ought not to vary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in Civils, it ſeems to be as Charitable and Juſt, as prudent to enact ſo, that neither Proteſtant nor Papiſt <hi>can be</hi> Tyrant or Rebel; but he ſhall be on ſuch terms, and in ſuch circumſtances, as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation ſtrong enough to either, will rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>One way to do this, (and it may be the beſt we can now take,) is, by Laws to damn the Maxims of State, the Rules and Principles of Government, which be either repugnant unto, or inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with our Old true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution in Civils.</p>
               <p>Is it not manifeſt, that our late frequent change of Miniſters have made no variation in Management of the State; and doth not this ſhew, we have need to ſearch out, what that is which maketh ſome (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed good) ſo ſoon as they be in ſubordinate Government, acting as the worſt of men; Alſo, that it concerns us to bar againſt Evil things rather than Perſons? Were our true Conſtitution re-inforced by Laws, and thoſe Laws duly edged, I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our Miniſters of State would have courage to adhere thereto, or would be ſo wiſe as not to treſpaſs thereupon. Eſpecially, if it be enacted, that their <hi>Iniquity</hi> ſhall be viſited unto the <hi>third or fourth Generation;</hi> as it is fit theirs ſhould be, who conſent to be ſo noxious to the Publick. The late Uſurper and Tyrant, <hi>Oliver,</hi> found <hi>two Laws</hi> of more force than the Perſons of <hi>Three Kingdoms.</hi> The Reaſon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101495:31"/>and the Authority in Laws remain, and will one time or other reach the Tranſgreſſor: which men being aware of, will not adventure to violate them at the Will, or by virtue of the Favour of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Perſon, who may change himſelf, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be changed, whereby the Law may come to be executed upon them. But where no Law is, or where it is defective, the Favour of the <hi>Prince,</hi> or preſent Profit, or the like, will diſpoſe Men to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe againſt Common Good.</p>
               <p>Beſides, thus to ſettle things in Laws, will be proceeding (for Common Benefit) like the Statute, or <hi>the Wiſdom that is from above,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Celeſtial) <hi>which is pure, peaceable,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> free from Luſt and Factious humor,) <hi>gentle, and eaſie to be entreated;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> mild, equitable, receding from ſtrict right in order to Peace;) <hi>full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> without making any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or without all inconſtancy, or danger of falling off to Tyranny or Levelling,) <hi>and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> without diſſimulation, or appearing to be what they are not;) ſuch as the falſe Ones in paſt Ages, which brought miſery to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>The Legal ſlaying of Treaſonable Principles or Rules, may rid us of Traytors for the future; though Perſons guilty of Treaſon, in time paſt, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to live.

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:101495:32"/>
But againſt this Two things may be objected, which I ſhall briefly mention, and reply to.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Object. 1.</hi> Where the Supream in Execution is <hi>One,</hi> it is <hi>beſt</hi> to remove from him the evil influence that is <hi>Perſonal; i. e.</hi> as we commonly ſay, <hi>Evil Counſellers, &amp;c.</hi> who will diſpoſe him to neglect, or draw him unto the contradiction of Laws.</q>
               <p>Suppoſing the Objector, by beſt, doth mean moſt <hi>effectual,</hi> or <hi>firſt to be done.</hi> I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Good Laws well enforced are a Bar againſt Evil mens influence: For when the Supream, or moſt Abſolute is gone forth in Laws, Men ſee he hath thereby bounded himſelf, ſo that it will be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and unſafe for them to propoſe a contrary practice to him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The removal of Perſons, without due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion by Laws, is a Change, but no Cure: It is taking off one Knave, to give place unto, or to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate another.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Evil Counſellors, or Plotters, rarely (if ever) are effectual in motion, but upon ſome <hi>alteration</hi> made in a well-framed Conſtitution; or when ſome <hi>defect</hi> or ſtart-hole is found in the Laws which be againſt them. Remove the Cauſe, and the Effect ceaſeth; whenas the aſſaulting Effects, and not (or too lightly) touching their Cauſes, is next to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nothing.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) The Heroick <hi>Prince</hi> is <hi>ſafeſt,</hi> and is moſt Auguſt in his Laws, which be for Common good: He covets there to be; as from his own Inclination, ſo becauſe he is thereby, as far as Man can be, a God,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101495:32"/>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> a Being ſo Almighty, as that to do evil, or to be tempted therewith, is (as it were) not poſſible to him. For good Laws to a Humane Prince, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with good Temper in him, and God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him, (allowing for diſproportion of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Infinite,) are to him, as perfect Rectitude in the Divine Nature is to God, ſuch <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> that evil cannot proceed from him, nor come nigh unto him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Object. 2.</hi> But do we not find the contrary, by the account we have of Laws, made in King <hi>H. 8.</hi> and King <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> which ſignified nothing in Queen <hi>Mary?</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1) The Repeals the Supream Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then made of Laws, in order to practices dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to them, ſhew they deemed force in them. When King, Lords and Commons agree to make paſt Laws weak, or nothing; who can give ſtrength, or give being to them?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Laws may effect now what they could not then; the Nations Temper or Bias, and their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt now, being, as it were, another thing; being ſuch, as no Parliament will be ever found to Repeal the Laws made. Beſides, we may now make Laws more compleat, and more noxious to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, than were thoſe heretofore made.</p>
               <p>I ſuper-add, as Anſwer to the firſt Objection,</p>
               <p n="5">(5) A Nation may with eaſe be cheated or impoſed upon by Perſonal removes: But Good Laws can never hurt; and if well ſharpned, will one time or other ſearch our Sore unto Healing.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101495:33"/>
(6.) Good Laws are moſt Humane, Chriſtian, and are what we may give good account of to our ſelves or others: In that neither <hi>Paſſion,</hi> nor Private <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,</hi> or the like, is in them; and are manifeſtations of our ſincere regard to Common Benefit, in the preſent, and in the future Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">I here inſert theſe words of Sir <hi>W. R.</hi> becauſe of their aptneſs to my purpoſe, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Writer. I had not ſight of them before I had wrote mine, and the Printer was upon this Sheet.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law, to wit, a juſt Law, being reſembled to an Heart without affection, to an Eye without luſt, and to Mind without paſſion; a Treaſure, which keepeth for every man what he hath, and diſtributeth to every man what he ought to have. This benefit the Ancient, though barbarous, eſteemed ſo highly, that among them thoſe which were taken for the firſt makers of Laws, were honoured as Gods, or the Sons of God: and the reſt, that made either Additions or Corrections, were commended to all Poſterity, for Men of no leſs vertue, and no leſs liberally beneficial to their Countries, than the greateſt and moſt proſperous Conquerors that ever governed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7) As Conſequent hereunto, ſuch proceedure is moſt agreeable to God, and doth entitle to his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; than which nothing can give more efficacy to Means, or more ſecure our deſired End. When men avoid evil, and prefer in preſent practice the <hi>greater</hi> good before the <hi>leſs,</hi> they are in God's way, and he is with them: Such need not fear what Man can do unto them.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) <hi>Differing</hi> about Means, or <hi>undue proſecuting</hi> of them, may occaſion fruſtration to good Men in their One End, <hi>viz. Publick-weal;</hi> and an undue proceedure herein is, where we treſpaſs upon the Natural order of things, <hi>i. e.</hi> when we prefer in our preſent practice the <hi>leſs</hi> good; or when by our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101495:33"/>of it, we render the Greater impoſſible, or very difficult to us.</p>
               <p>By eſtimation there are a hundred Commoners choſen to ſerve in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> (expected to Aſſemble ſhortly,) whoſe intereſt in Lands amounts in value to Three hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> by which Inſtance, (as by many other) it is apparent, the <hi>Commons</hi> have far greater ſhare or intereſt in <hi>England</hi> now, than in Ages heretofore. Security and reaſonable ſatisfaction, is therefore their due: And in that their ſaid acquired Intereſt hath added ſo great ſtrength unto them, it is their Princes ſafety to grant it.</p>
               <p>Good Laws are moſt conducive to a Right Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in the Kingdoms of Men. The <hi>Right of Caſes,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon of Things,</hi> (as now they ſtand,) is to be regarded, or kept to by <hi>Legiſlators,</hi> in order thereunto. If nothing be done herein, the Government is not like to ſtand; which by paſt evil practice, and by preſent diſcontent or jealouſie in People, is made, <hi>as a bowing wall, and as a tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering fence.</hi> And if Laws made, or to be made, ſuit not well unto the Right of Caſes, and to the Reaſon of Things, they will ſoon prove uneaſie or oppreſſive; ſo that the Monarchy may be overthrown thereby. For the <hi>Royal Preacher</hi> (when moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious) hath ſaid, <hi>Surely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad,</hi> Eccl. 7.7.</p>
               <p>Let, then, our Legiſlators be faithful to our King, and in him to the Nation; ſo as not to environ him with Danger by Laws, or let ought therein remain, that may be juſtly uneaſie to Great, and to Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101495:34"/>
Though I am not for making ſad (needleſly or unjuſtly) any one of this Kingdom, in his Religious Intereſt, &amp;c. Yet I would be underſtood in this place, to have regard only, or chiefly to Civils; wherein this Nation, under every diſpenſation, as to Religion, even from (if not before) <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to this day, hath been, as it were, <hi>One.</hi> The Laws therefore which recover or reinforce this Conſtitution, will be of more certain efficacy and continuance, than thoſe which concern Religion; in that a Superiour Law was ever pretended upon every change in the latter, when the former hath remained untouched, both under Popiſh, and under Proteſtant Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Protestantiſm</hi> is the Temper and Intereſt of a People, (as it is now ours in <hi>England,</hi>) I cannot ſee any one thing a greater defence againſt our being <hi>Popiſh,</hi> than is this, of well ſecuring our Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and by Law providing for ſuch Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may evidence its Being, and the Executors conformity thereunto.</p>
               <p>I would not be ſuppoſed (by ought I have ſaid) in a deſign to prevent all neceſſary proceedure; that is, (as we ſay) <hi>Perſonal; i. e.</hi> the bringing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Judgment, &amp;c. when the Publick good, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with their Merit, do require it. But this I heartily deſire, that we may not injure Our King, or our Country, by paſſing this opportunity, and leaving undone that in Laws, without which the other will not heal us; being not ſo extenſive as our preſent Malady is, nor ſo preventive of a Relapſe as the other would be. There are thoſe who will give Heads (if they have ſo many <hi>Calves</hi>) by the dozen, ſo they may not be debarred the Old trade of graſing, in order to a New breed. And there
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101495:34"/>have been, or there may be, many Rogues in deſign to Rob a Houſe, who by fore-contrivance have one perſonating an honeſt Neighbour, that upon the repulſe or flight of ſome, is to cry <hi>Stop Thief, &amp;c.</hi> in hope the Maſter and his Family, in haſte to purſue, may omit to lock the Door, or leave the Houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded; ſo that other of them may with eaſe gain the Prize they came for.</p>
               <p>I have alſo heard, that to burn the <hi>Pipes</hi> was once thought ſufficient to extinguiſh future ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tobacco.</hi> I leave the Wiſe to apply theſe, (though fooliſh, yet well intended) Suggeſtions.</p>
               <p>From what I have ſaid on this Head, may be alſo collected, the neceſſity of making Laws, that may keep every man (be he <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant</hi>) from doing hurt, or from receiving it. To which I will here ſuper-add, Suppoſe the <hi>Soveraign Real</hi> find it for Publick good requiſite to bound the Sovereign or <hi>Supream Perſon,</hi> ſhould their Laws reſpect a <hi>Papiſt</hi> only; It would be rare for a Prince, in his wits, to own, or ſhew himſelf to be one, before he is Crowned; after which thoſe Laws affect him not. But be it, that he owns <hi>Popery</hi> before <hi>Coronation;</hi> yet the Laws will prove as weak in effect as if none: becauſe they will be ſuperſeded, or made void by the Law of Holy Church and Father at <hi>Rome.</hi> For all Laws made in bar againſt them, or made to limit a <hi>Papiſt</hi> as ſuch, and made about Religion (except their own Canons, &amp;c.) are <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> Null; whenas, if the Law be without diſtinction, without partiality, or doth make no difference, and hath reſpect only to Civils, there is no Holy Law to ſuperſede it; nor do I know, that in paſt Ages they, at any time, have interpoſed therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:101495:35"/>
Again, being our <hi>Legiſlators</hi> are Proteſtants, if they make not Laws as effectual to <hi>ſecure</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Prince,</hi> from things ſo noxious to him, as is <hi>Popery, Tyranny,</hi> or <hi>Rebellion, &amp;c.</hi> they be leſs kind, and more unfaithful to him than to a Papiſt; which God forbid ours in <hi>England</hi> ſhould ever be.</p>
               <p>I have already mentioned, that the ſecuring our Conſtitution in Civils, is bar againſt Popery. In far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence whereof, let it be noted how conſtant the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are in adviſing and practiſing to <hi>alter</hi> our Government, either into <hi>Anarchy, Democracy,</hi> or into <hi>Abſolute Monarchy.</hi> Had I time and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to expreſs what I have abundant reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I could plentifully ſhew, how induſtriouſly thoſe Vipers ſeek to prey upon our <hi>Vitals</hi> in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. They would ſing <hi>Te Deum</hi> for the <hi>Death</hi> of our King; be it of his <hi>Body Natural,</hi> by the hand of Blood-thirſty Men; or be it of him <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Political,</hi> by the Self-killing I have oft mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. His <hi>Father's</hi> Death (in the former way) had their <hi>Heart</hi> and their <hi>Hand</hi> in it; alſo unto God they (moſt Blaſphemouſly) gave thanks for it.</p>
               <p>The preceding Analyſes, do ſet forth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity or ſeaſons, as one Talent the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> hath to improve. To do ſo is Wiſdom; it doth give us to obtain with eaſe and certainty. When the <hi>Prodigal</hi> (Luke 15.) <hi>had ſpent all, and began to be in want;</hi> then was it that the Supream <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> applied unto him Recovering or Saving <hi>Grace.</hi> Laws being, (as I have ſhewn) the weightier Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſhould you now execute, (only on Perſons, ſome may be prone to ſay,) <hi>Wo unto you: Theſe ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone,</hi>

               <p>This Section, being directed to the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and to the <hi>Supream</hi> of this Nation; I muſt not purſue things too far, or deſcend to more particulars, ſo as to incur their juſt diſpleaſure, or the imputation of over-doing.</p>
               <p>I judge (as a Great Man<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Kawleigh.</note> hath directed me,) that Temperament beſt for the Throne, which makes the People <hi>Loving, and free of courage;</hi> for Kings being attended by <hi>Slaves,</hi> ſhall be attended in time of neceſſity by <hi>Slaviſh minds. Homer</hi> ſpeaks to this purpoſe, <hi>God bereaveth man of half his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that day, when he caſteth him into bondage.</hi> And <hi>Charron</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Popular Eſtate makes the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of worſe condition than a Carter: The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy placeth him above God himſelf;</hi> by either of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101495:36"/>which a Nation is made unhappy. If ſo, it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any, what methods a Prince ſhould chooſe to govern his People by. <hi>To be a good Governour, is a rare Commendation; and to preſerve the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick above all reſpects whatſoever, is the vertue juſtly termed Heroical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid it doth appear, Our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> in ſpecial, ought to aſſiſt herein; becauſe they know that the Humane Law depending on that of Nature, deduced from God's Eternal Law, (which is the Rule of all his Creatures,) is the guard of Kings, Magiſtrates, and Vertuous Men; yea, the very Spirit, and the very Sinews of every Eſtate in the World, by which, (as Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſaith,) they live and move. Beſides, if we provide not hereby to have Humane and God-like Kings, we may not expect to enjoy Chriſtian and Proteſtant Biſhops. Devil and Pope be never long aſunder; if the one gains the Throne, the other will ſoon poſſeſs the Church. We being (as we are almoſt univerſally) Proteſtants; once make us no <hi>true Engliſh,</hi> it will in ſhort time be no true Religion in <hi>England.</hi> Proteſtant Biſhops, to ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Advance (ſo termed, though falſly) of the King, ſecured, is a fatal miſtake and miſchief. To ſay or think, there is no harm if Prerogative be higher now, than it was in the time of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> or before 1660, and to fix it, or to permit it to remain ſo, in Law, is to bring <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Leveller</hi> in upon us; whereby our Religion, as our Liberty, will be loſt, or our King and Lords, (when leaſt, the Biſhops) ſhall be deemed uſeleſs, if not dangerous things.</p>

Though ſome of Excellency therein, did ſome Months ſince decline counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the indiſcreet management of ſome, who were then upon it. For though the Subject hath ever Right to do it, be the King for it or againſt it, yet Prudence may require ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Execution.</note> and do their <hi>Own buſineſs, i. e.</hi> keep within the Churches Pale. I will not diſpute their right in Civils, ſuppoſe it theirs; yet I think it their intereſt at this time, and moſt Apoſtolical, to act as more Divine. Look ye, O Men of God, unto <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, the author and finiſher of our Faith;</hi> unto the Apoſtles, eſpecially to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> to the <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> in Holy Writ; to Archbiſhop <hi>

I ſay look unto theſe, (and many more there are,) who with thoſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>compaſs you about,</hi> which ſhould diſpoſe you to <hi>lay aſide every weight,</hi> love to this World, <hi>and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet you;</hi> fear of Man, which diſpoſeth to Cowardize and Treachery (whereby you will become, not only the Dead Weight, but Death to our State and Church;) or that of Uncharitably preſſing Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in matters, for which you have only fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>Ye are taught of God, and have been of late ſo well ſuggeſted unto by the <hi>Dean of Canterbury,</hi> in his excellent Sermon to the Men of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> alſo heretofore by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Pious Diſcourſes; <hi>Gildas Salvianus, &amp;c.</hi> that to them I refer.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Let all <hi>Subjects</hi> in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> ſtudy to be quiet, and do their <hi>Own buſineſs. Bite</hi> their own fingers, rather than <hi>ſcratch their Head:</hi>

               <p>What I have ſaid in a fore-going Section, about the Subordination of Duties, may much aſſiſt you herein; for you will find Obedience to Magiſtrates one of the Capitals, and <hi>Honour the King,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with <hi>Fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The excellent Preacher concludes his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Eccl.</hi> Chap. 10. with a ſtrict prohibition of all hard and undutiful thoughts and riſings of heart againſt Rulers, notwithſtanding their errours in Government and Corruption in living; not ſo much as ſecretly in their hearts to wrong them, both for Conſcience, and for <hi>fear of wrath,</hi> as the Apoſtle likewiſe directeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) To the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe being ſo, and being made ſo, is matter of grief to me: I ſay to them, ſtudy to be quiet, and do your <hi>Own buſineſs.</hi> Which, (beſide what <hi>Doctor Stilling fleet</hi> in his late Sermon, and others before have told you,) is to do what Laws do not forbid you, what is moſt needed, what you are ſpecially qualified unto; what the beſt of you (in times paſt, when aſſociated for moſt good) have recommended as great Duty, and lamented paſt neglect as grievous Sin. And what if now managed with prudence and love, will (as I think) bring more Souls unto God,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101495:37"/>and more comfort and profit to your ſelves, than the way of exerciſe you are in. It is, Sirs, to go from houſe to houſe in the Pariſhes where you inhabit, upon the work of <hi>Perſonal</hi> Inſtruction. The nature whereof, the manner of performance, the motive and obligation thereunto, may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <hi>Reformed Pastor, Christian Concord,</hi> the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi> and other Counties <hi>Agreements,</hi> to which I refer. I do not foreſee what you can object here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; neither do I think ought will happen to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you therein, (from without,) but what may ſoon be removed by care, prudence, humility, and love in its management. My ſelf for one, (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more there are,) who do not receive you, or contribute to you in your preſent way of Separation, would do their utmoſt to ſtrengthen and encourage you herein: And thoſe who now are joyned to you, if true Chriſtians, will in no wiſe draw back; but rather proceed for ſo good a work.</p>
               <p>Yet if any of them, (who have not well learned wherein Purity, Spirituality, and true Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty conſiſteth) through ſuſpicion of your return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or to <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from you; God will make it up in others, and will (if they be ſincere) reveal himſelf farther to them, and bring them back with advantage to you.</p>
               <p>It is now near twenty four years ſince the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pious Mr. <hi>Tho. Wadſworth,</hi> (now with God) expreſſed to me at <hi>Newington-Buts,</hi> to this effect: <hi>When I came firſt to miniſter at this place, I began to think my buſineſs lay not ſo much in my Pulpit, as in the Houſes of my Flock, not to eat or drink with them, or there to receive a Fleece from them;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101495:38"/>but to bring them fully to God: I therefore inquired who were worthy, and whoſo conſented, into their Houſes I entred on ſome daies weekly. I was yet not ſatisfied, being I ſaw many Families, within my Pariſh bounds, remaining ignorant of, and averſe unto God: And being ſometime after quickned by Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>in private Letters to me, and his</hi> Gildas Salvianus, <hi>I reſolved upon and exerciſed Perſonal and Family Inſtruction through my whole Pariſh. I found many obſtinate, and many diſmally ignorant, equal to the darkest corner in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe. But I thank God, my labour was not in vain, They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought, by my Houſe-miniſtration, unto the light and life Divine. I had more ſucceſs in one year in this way, than I could expect in twenty the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miniſters ought to ſeek out the bad, to make them good; gathering and edifying thoſe who are made ſo to their hand, is the <hi>leſs</hi> needful work. I ſhould not doubt of ſucceſs herein, ſomewhat equal to what appeared in <hi>Newington</hi> many years ſince, God being as preſent, and as powerful now as then. But I muſt humbly offer this to them, that they treat us not with <hi>Mint, Aniſe,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> but with the <hi>weighty matters of the Law,</hi> with what recommends itſelf to every man's Conſcience. And ſo diſcourſe, that both matter and manner thereof may manifeſt, you deſign not to beget diſlike to the Publick Forms, &amp;c. but only to bring us more fully to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to that temper and practice which King, Biſhops, and People, cannot but ſee, is beſt for the whole.</p>
               <p>This I own, is the Duty alſo of every Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſter, and the neglect thereof their Sin. I wiſh you were both at it with all your might; for this, under God, would procure ſuch degrees of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101495:38"/>Light, Life and Love, that our Service to God would be ſerving him in <hi>Spirit and Truth,</hi> and an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service unto him, though it were performed in the worſt form I ever yet heard of among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
               <p>To the pure Worſhipper all theſe Forms are pure, <hi>i. e.</hi> none of them ſhall prejudice a good Man, or his ſacrifice to God. If this be ſo, we have gained this point; That to be <hi>holy,</hi> is far preferrable to pure Adminiſtrations, ſince the pureſt of them are not pure to the unholy. Should not then the means, moſt likely to increaſe Holineſs, be deareſt unto us? and ſuch, as hath been ſaid, is Perſonal Inſtruction; eſpecially, if we add, that this practice will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive of <hi>Love,</hi> than which there cannot be a more purifying Grace? Which brings me to the Second General Head; of which I ſhall diſcourſe in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>Let,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.16.</note> then, our whole be Love; let it be the temper and abode of our Souls.

               <p>By the natural intimacy of Self-love, by our own frame, by the nature of God, his love and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us as Creator, and in Jeſus Chriſt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: as alſo by the nature and end of his Ordinances, &amp;c. of which many have treated, we may ſee, as our obligation and inducements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſo alſo the true nature and offices of Love.</p>

               <p n="3">(3) The nature and effects of love. Happineſs is connatural with love, they are inſeparable. Whilſt love <hi>preſides,</hi> the Nation muſt ceaſe to be before it can be other than happy; by it Societies are ſo formed, that all their parts are made bleſſed thereby:

               <p>Where Love diſpoſeth to aſſociate, with what pleaſant guſts do they go thereto? and ſo ſoon as they be gathered, it binds them faſt together: ſo united, as none dare to offend them, and ſo inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as not to provoke others.</p>
               <p>The foundation of their Concord, is the root or ſtock of <hi>Peace;</hi> yea,<note place="margin">Iſai. 30.27.</note> of quietneſs and aſſurance for ever, being <hi>An Obediential Faith and Affiance in God, as he in Chriſt, is reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> extended in great <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> true <hi>Charity, Purity</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> theſe good things they learn of God, theſe are their buſineſs and delight, and by theſe they continually walk with him, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. They eſtabliſh their Union by ſuch Principles and Rules, as will make all concerned in the State under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that their intereſt is cared for.</p>
               <p>The Union appears to be <hi>Common Benefit:</hi> ſo ſettled, as fore-ſeeing the whole cannot be happy where any part is miſerable. In a word, they unite and abide as Members one of another. Therefore if any be afflicted, they (like good blood) run to the wounded parts relief.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> is to love God above all, and to love others as themſelves.

               </p>
               <p>The former is done by prohibiting, and watchfully ſuppreſſing <hi>all Vice,</hi> eſpecially thoſe which are moſt noxious to Publick Order and Intereſt: Such as <hi>Atheiſm, Prophaneneſs, Contempt of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Peeviſh moroſeneſs,</hi> and <hi>Flattery:</hi> Alſo, <hi>Revenge,</hi> excepting that of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,</hi> if the Injury be private; and when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that proſecution publick Juſtice and general Good requires to bring Traytors, againſt King or State, to juſt puniſhment.

               <p>There is one other evil they prohibit and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuppreſs, <hi>viz.

(2) <hi>Neighbourly;</hi> in order to this latter, They bear their Infirmities and cover their Faults, until they can be ſhewn them in private, and there they do it with greateſt ſweetneſs. They never reprove Sinners publickly, but for moſt weighty cauſes; and then ſo do it, that the Guilty may ſee their love is fervent, and may be awakened; not through lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and noiſe, but by the ſmart, though yet ſweet, penetration of Reaſon and Love: which ſhines ſo clearly in his Corrections, that the Offender cannot but grieve for himſelf, when he ſees the Reprover was ſorry for him firſt.</p>
               <p>They command Seriouſneſs without Moroſity, and enjoyn Chearfulneſs without Levity. They preſcribe Patience, whereby to ſecure Self-poſſeſſion againſt Moral-ſlavery and loſs. And that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies may eſcape their notice and aſpirings, they have one act which hath more than ordinary Sanction; you will find it <hi>Verbatim</hi> thus: <hi>Finally,</hi>

               <p>Theſe are ſome hints at the <hi>State of Love,</hi> which may ſuffice to prove, that whereever it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide or prevail, it ſettleth and ſecureth <hi>happineſs.</hi>

He apprehends himſelf as the mean between God and the People, <hi>i.e.</hi> that he is debtor to both, and accordingly all his practice is Piety towards the one, and Beneficence to the other. He abuſeth not himſelf by thinking he is his own man, or by tying himſelf to himſelf. He acts as he is the States, and not as if the State were his.</p>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101495:45"/>
(2) He with diligence or care rules his Subjects <hi>by Law;</hi> I mean here, (though I except not God's) the Laws himſelf, with his People (in their Repreſentative) as one, have made: Thoſe being, eſpecially if they be for Common good, alwaies moſt ſacred or dear to him. In Mean towards the People, rather a Guardian or Surety, than their Lord or Maſter.</item>
                     <item>(3) He aſcends unto the hearts of his Subjects, as to the ſafeſt, the higheſt and moſt deſirable Throne, and by conſtant goodneſs and ſeaſonable bounty, (like God) he gains that gift from them. Which when he hath gotten, neither <hi>Wife</hi> nor <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> nor any other <hi>importuning thing,</hi> can diſpoſe him to hazard or forfeit; but ſecure it he doth to himſelf, and to his for ever, in applying alwaies thereto what gained them at firſt, chooſing rather to be loved, than to be adored by them.</item>
                     <item>(4) He will not make Evil daies, or confederate with or aſſiſt thoſe who do ſo; by Blood, by Rapin, by Truce-breaking, or by being <hi>without natural affection</hi> to his People; or ſuch like, mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) His Practices more private, are of like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For, (1) He chooſeth ſuch Miniſters of State and Law whoſe temper is ſound, and moſt ſutable to Law, and who will unmoveably adhere thereto. He judgeth of their temper, by their conforming in practice to God's and to his own Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> he ſhuns, as leſs Divine, and moſt Inhumane. He deems Tempters thereto Imps of Hell, well knowing that no other Prince, than he who is the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> leads men captive <hi>at his will.</hi> He therefore carefully avoids,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101495:46"/>as the occaſion, ſo the appearance of this evil. By which he appears to be no mean ſpirited thing; as it is felicity to have power to do what a man will, ſo is it true greatneſs to will that a man ſhould. Hereby in temper he is a-kin to the Greateſt Majeſty in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; who therefore commands, becauſe the things are for our good,<note place="margin">Deut. 10.12, 13. Micah 6.8.</note> and who ſometimes propoſeth to reaſon the matter out with us. Alſo, frequently appeals to Senſe or Conſcience within us, about the equity, and the abundant, and the condeſcending kindneſs he hath done us, ſaying oft,<note place="margin">Iſal. 5.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Are not my waies equal, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Or this, <hi>And now, O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and Men of Judah; Judge I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard. What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is indeed one ſort of Prerogative, which in imitation of God he is ſometimes in, <hi>i.e.</hi> to perform acts of Goodneſs, and to ſcatter abroad or diſperſe what is gracious to the deſervers of Evil. Theſe he may do, becauſe he will do them; for herein is no hurt, ſo Prudence direct, as it alwaies doth in him. But when the thing to be done will be pain, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to any; that it then ſhall be done, becauſe <hi>I will,</hi> I find not with God, nor with Good men: I was about to ſay, only with men, as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) He admits none to come to places in Church or State by unworthy means, nor hinders them in the diſcharge of their Truſts by obſtinate manners. He <hi>ſuffers not to ſtay in his preſence</hi> any who dare <hi>to lie</hi> for his or their own advantage;<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> and <hi>Flatterers</hi> are as <hi>falſe Witneſſes</hi> in his Judgment and Inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

(5) He receives into his Counſel no other than ſuch who are generous, above being corrupted with Money: and the Couragious, who dare to adviſe, and do what is juſt, though it doth (which is near impoſſible, if ſo, that it ſhould) diſpleaſe him, his own defects not excepted. He is for faithful and conſtant Advertiſement of all things.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) He with diligence and care governs himſelf, to eſcape diſcompoſure by humor, and to ſtrengthen meekneſs in diſpoſition; by which he is perſpicacious in underſtanding, and prudent in managing all his Affairs. He is temperate and grave, comporting with Authority; and diſgraceth it not by luxury or luſt.</p>
               <p>Time would fail me, were I able to ſay the whole of the excellencies in this Prince.</p>
               <p>If God would utter by voice, the leaſt I ſhould expect to hear, would be; <hi>Behold my Servant, a man after my own heart! Behold a Prince, my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Son! I am well pleaſed with him; yea, he is my delight, Honour and Obey ye him.</hi> And would God ſpeak more, I fancy it would be ſomewhat thus; <hi>Not for your ſakes, O People, do I this, but for my own Name ſake; and becauſe I loved you, I have raiſed up this Prince for a Bleſſing to you. And though you have Enemies, and the hands of thoſe that hate you, are at work to destroy you;</hi>

                  <hi>GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 1. and 2.</note> 
                  <hi>who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath now in theſe laſt daies ſpoken unto us by his Son; therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward: How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> As this Love would give us, for eſcaping out of the vicious Cuſtoms of this World, and for our deliverance, as out of the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we feel, ſo in preventing thoſe we fear, or do deſerve. God alſo having thereunto born witneſs, and farther invited us, both with Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and with diverſe Workings, ſuch as have not been in any one Age before us; as will appear to any by the following Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) What was the more than Twenty years affliction our King and we were under, by Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101495:48"/>at firſt, and after, a Civil War; by Uſurpation, Tyranny, Murthers, (in which was ſhed moſt Sacred Blood,) and at laſt, violation of all right, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by Will, againſt Law? I ſay, what was all this for, but to School us into Love? For did not the Inflicters pretend, our Perſecuting, our Impoſing and Innovating in the Church, our ruling by Will againſt Law, and thereby deſtroying Liberty and Property in the State, to be their Motive thereunto?</p>
               <p>And did they not whip us with theſe Rods, and viſit us with theſe very Stripes, doing to us, really and in high degree, what they falſly, or too far charged on us? By which we ſeemed to be as <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibezek,</hi> Judg. 1.7. <hi>Suſpicions,</hi> though groundleſs, or a <hi>Charge,</hi> though falſe, ſhould be improved to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caution and diſtance. And is it not leſs manly than a Child is, to affect or reach toward that by which we have ſo ſorely ſmarted?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) What was our King's, and with his our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, but God's call to Love?</p>
               <p>For, (1) Was it not began, and compleated without fury or one drop of Blood? A thing, as Circumſtances then were, not poſſible to any, ſave he who did it, namely God, who is, and was therein, Almighty Love.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Did not the main Inſtruments, under God, therein (after too long enmity between us) love us <hi>firſt?</hi> For they invited us home, and received us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impoſing ought upon us. If Love had not ruled in them, as they might have demanded, ſo we muſt have granted their demands: Which act of theirs doth at once both teach and oblige us to Love. But ſuppoſe our Reſtauration was not their procurement, but our own Victory. This is to be ſaid, it was Bloodleſs, and coſt us not one blow: and had its coſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101495:49"/>been never ſo dear, yet Victory to generous minds is only an inducement to Moderation. It is a glorious Victory to conquer, and to make our Enemy ſtoop by Benefits, and of an Enemy to become a Friend.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) What have our days ſince been, but ſo many ſundry times, in which God hath called us to this connected and comprehenſive Love?</p>
               <p>For, (1) The Happy Reſtauration, giving Being and vigour unto Love, <hi>Peace</hi> was within our Walls, and <hi>Proſperity</hi> in our Palaces. Our Face was then moſt attractive of Love; like unto that I have (in the fore-going Chapter) deſcribed the State of <hi>Love</hi> to be. Not as a Kingdom, which is become pale or wan through ſhivering or Swooning-fits: nor like a Nation diſpirited or bleeding, by ſome alteration in ancient Conſtitutions, or Aſcertaining points, which the wiſdom of Anceſtors thought beſt for the whole to keep doubtful; or granting (through Inadvertency, Corruption, or under pretence of Affection) ſo many and ſo great Impoſitions, as to make both Prince and People as Poor as <hi>Spain:</hi> Or as may ſometime or other be improved to alter a whole Frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or by New terms of Miniſtration or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Church, or ſuch like things; which never are, but when Love grows cold, and when a Plague diſeaſe attends a Nation.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Our Glory was too ſoon eclipſed by hidden <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> I mean the horrid <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Contrivances,</hi> and ſundry <hi>&amp; caetera's;</hi> things which be, as in their nature, ſo for my intended bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, too many for me. So pernicious is the firſt ſtep from <hi>Love,</hi> that when we begin to deviate from it, we ſcarce eſcape perdition. If ought interpoſe to re-call us, as once did his Majeſty's gracious Commiſſion to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101495:49"/>treat at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> alſo his gracious Declaration in matters Eccleſiaſtical; yet on we go, and needs we muſt, when <hi>Ill-will</hi> doth drive us. <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> with it, muſt be re-eſtabliſhed; and no doubt of the Peoples acceptance; <hi>For</hi> (ſaid one Right Reverend, as I was credibly informed) <hi>in every Town (with Popular applauſe) the</hi> May-pole <hi>is reſtored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being that new Additions were convenient to keep from Conformity the beſt of the Brethren; why was it not as wiſe to think, the Novelties to be added would alſo pleaſe; becauſe at or abou that very time there were added (in deſign or fact) ſome Cubits in height to the <hi>May-pole</hi> in the <hi>Strand?</hi> So vain do the beſt of Men become, when they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Love.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Soon after came War and Plague, then Fire, with moſt diſtreſſing Jealouſies at home; and then War again from abroad. With every of theſe we were ſorely afflicted, and in the laſt put to open<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Chatham.</hi> James 4.5.</note> ſhame. Now from whence came all theſe on us, came they not hence, <hi>even of our luſts, that war in our members?</hi> And is it not, think ye, high time for us to return to Love, who have thus ſmarted by and for the contrary thereunto?</p>
               <p n="4">(4) What is the late diſcovery of the Plot, and the preſervation of our King to this day; but the declaration from Heaven, for Love? That God doth and will interpoſe to ſave the Friend and the State thereof, (and ſuch, though too weak therein, may our King and State be deemed, compared with other Nations.) Which will farther appear, if ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in this diſcovery be duly conſidered. As,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:101495:50"/>
(1) Were the firſt Diſcoverers other than mean, few, and ſtrange Ones too: attempting it moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagiouſly? like as when men reveal matter of higheſt Treaſon to they know not who, or like as when <hi>Andrew</hi> comes to diſcover to <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy,</hi> how that <hi>James</hi> intends to rob or kill <hi>John,</hi> (on purpoſe that <hi>John</hi> knowing it, may ſave both, <hi>i.e.</hi> life and money; and as <hi>Andrew</hi> thought, ſave <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Levy</hi> too;) whereas <hi>Simeon,</hi> for ſome time before, had been picking <hi>John</hi>'s Pocket, and <hi>Levy</hi> in the ſame gainful Confederacy, had been ſuggeſting unto <hi>John</hi> to kill himſelf. If <hi>Titus,</hi> in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s daies, wrote, <hi>Killing</hi> no <hi>Murther; Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> (if he pleaſeth) may now print no word of <hi>Killing,</hi> leſt <hi>Murther</hi> come out.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Were not many, and ſome no ſmall Ones, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing its diſcovery: One while Brow-beating to diſcourage, and other while bribing to corrupt the Witneſſes: hiding Papers, and ſtifling many Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations brought to them, relating thereunto? On account of theſe (I preſume) it was that the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> choſe to proceed by a Committee of Secreſie, in the examination of this Plot; for had they then been (or ſhould they hereafter be,) more publick herein; the ſame Power and Artifice uſed to prevent diſcovery, will be applied to Sham the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the publick Trials of the Plotters. In which I ſhall leſs doubt of the ſucceſs they deſire, in caſe this advantage be given them, to know afore-hand the full Proof that is againſt them, and the whole management thereof: for they ſeem to me to be in other reſpects, at this time, not meanly aſſiſted for an eſcape.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:101495:50"/>
(3) Hath it not remained to be a Plot, after all Attempts to extirpate or weaken the belief of it, by talking of Old ones, (40, 41, 42, and 48,) and framing of New ones? And is not its Credibility ſtrengthned, by the Attempts made to make it fall?</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Was not our King's life in unparallel'd dangers? and if he doth not believe his Death was conſulted or conſpired, is not that one of them? and yet he liveth. And doth not all this tell us, God is for Love; ſeeing he, as it were, immediately appeareth to bring to nought the devices of Devils and Men againſt it? So that it ſeems now, as if Heaven had ordained, that no hand ſhall plant<note n="†" place="margin">Alteration in Civils.</note> Thorns anew, as none ſhall gather Grapes of thoſe of Old planted with us. Should any then proceed to contend with God, and to attempt what they muſt fail in; Will not the one be Impiety, and the other greateſt folly?</p>
               <p n="6">(6) The wild and cruel Methods, which ſome have taken to introduce a happy <hi>Millennium,</hi> have been detected in the ſtrange and horrid practices of <hi>Vennour</hi> and his Company; and God's hatred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, manifeſted in their puniſhment. And inſtead thereof, others (of ſingular Learning and Piety) in our Church, have ſtated it more conſonant; as to general expectation, ſo to the nature of God, and to the Laws of his Creation and Providence. A Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of which I will give you in the words of the excellent Doctor <hi>More.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Preface to</hi> Myſtery of Godlineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>The true happineſs of thoſe daies is not to be meaſured by Formalities or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but by a more corroborated Faith in Christ and his Promiſes; by Devotion unfeigned, by Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart and Innocency of life; by Faithfulneſs,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101495:51"/>by common Charity, by comfortable Proviſions for the Poor; by chearful Obedience to our Superiours, and abundance of Kindneſs and diſcreet Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions one to another; by unſpotted Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and an unſhaken Peace; by the removal of every unjust Yoke; by mutual Forbearance, and bearing up one another as living Stones of that Temple, where there is not to be heard the noiſe of either Ax or Hammer; no ſquabble or clamour about Forms or Opinions, but a peaceable ſtudy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of provoking one another to Love and good Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I, with the Worthy Doctor's help, have ſaid on this Head, beareth along with it both a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and reprehenſion of the degeneracy of the preſent Age, and a warmth and encouragement to haſten theſe good Times, by endeavouring to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Lives according to this Pattern we have of them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Our true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, in Laws, and Temper, in Perſons, while we do no violence, nor ſuffer it to be done to either, doth diſpoſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Love, beyond any Conſtitution or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in other Nations;<note place="margin">Luk. 19.12, 13.</note> which is a <hi>Talent</hi> Chriſt hath given us to traffick with in his abſence, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to improve it to his beſt advantage, that he may receive the benefit of it when he returneth, and may ſee our increaſe unto God, when he ſhall come and ſhew himſelf in that Regal illuſtrious manner upon us. We then hide our Lord's Money, and ſhall be doomed as <hi>unprofitable Servants,</hi> as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters of his Perſon and Government, and executed for being Enemies thereunto, if we uſe it not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Love.</p>

               <p>We alſo in this World, may equal in glory or fame the greateſt of Kingdoms, and be deemed by all People, the moſt worthy Nation. And farther,</p>
               <p n="6">(6) We may, ſubordinate to Chriſt, <hi>be a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> and be God's Salvation to the ends of the Earth; <hi>i.e.</hi> Revealers to them of God's Righteouſneſs, or the way of Living, which is acceptable unto, and which is bleſt by him.</p>
               <p>We may alſo be <hi>the glory of his People Iſrael,</hi> i.e. Reformers of the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> bringing them from the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> alſo the Religion of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> bringing them from empty Forms, dividing and burthenſom Rites; from Opinions which gender Strife; from precepts about Meats and Drinks, &amp;c. unto the Kingdom of God, to Righteouſneſs, to Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> Mercifulneſs, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and a delight to do good one to another; to that Joy which reſults from Unanimity, holy Chriſtian Joy, which is according to the will of God, and wrought by his Spirit.

               </p>
               <p>Whenever a Kingdom appears made up of ſuch King and Subjects, as thoſe be who are dwellers in Love, it will be <hi>Omen,</hi> that God is near to draw all Nations to himſelf: like the Morning Star, after the Night of blackneſs or thick darkneſs, will indicate the Day at hand, wherein <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs will ariſe,</hi> on the Univerſe, <hi>with healing under his wing,</hi> to give unto ſick and loſt Man ſaving and eternal health. The fame and greatneſs of their proſperity will be ſo, as to compel the blind, the halt and maimed Nations, to come to taſt of their Feaſt; and taſting will ſee and diſlike, as their enjoyments, ſo all their practices in a State far from God. They will alſo begin to ariſe or go to their true Father, who, ſo ſoon as he ſees them up and going, will run and embrace them; will ſhew his love, and manifeſt himſelf and his Will to them; in which they will find abundant ſtrength and true joy: not as their former, which, if at all, was but ſcant or fooliſh laughter, and at beſt as the <hi>crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</hi> for melody and duration.</p>

               <head>SECT. I.</head>
               <p>IN order to our being what I have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in this Diſcourſe, I ſhall propoſe to ſome Directions; (1) More general, (2) More ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The General Direction ſhall be to Four things:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Look we diligently, leſt any root of <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> be ſpringing up in us. Theſe are ſo oppoſite to what I have been propoſing, that they be the only troubling and defiling things; theſe will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion any man to fail of the Grace of God: for they be poyſon and death to Love. What natural name they have, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> will tell you; the one names it, <hi>the law in our members,</hi> the other,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. James 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>our luſts;</hi> in the one is pointed to us its Commanding power, in the other its being Brutiſh; and in both that it is a warring thing; in war againſt Reaſon, and againſt the Soul of Man; againſt the direction of God's Spirit, and then againſt every body elſe.</p>
               <p>The looking diligently and honeſtly within you, will ſoon inform you what it is, and what names I ſhould here give them. Of all theſe bitter roots, none to a Nation are ſo certainly and ſo ſpeedily mortal, as thoſe of <hi>affecting to be flattered, Revenge,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:101495:56"/>and being <hi>without natural affection;</hi> in the Ruler, or the Governours ſubordinate to him; <hi>Suſpicion, Jealouſies</hi> or <hi>Fears,</hi> and <hi>affectation of Change,</hi> and an Opinion of having <hi>Political Science,</hi> in the People.</p>
               <p>I deſcend not to other particulars, and ſay no more of theſe, becauſe the next Direction, if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, will ſurely cure all at once.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Let us be willing to be truly Religious or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in Intellect and Will, in Affection and Practice, <hi>i.e.</hi> that the whole of us tend to God, and be given to him. So that upon <hi>All,</hi> which is either Naturally or Providentially ours, we write with our own hand, (<hi>i.e.</hi> moſt heartily,) <hi>This is the Lord's.</hi> I know God works in us <hi>both to will and to do;</hi> but how? ſo as that we likewiſe refuſe not to work. He ſtands and knocks, and we muſt open or he comes not in.<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting Doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in.</hi> View this King of Glory until ye be enamour'd of his Divine perfections; ſearch or ſeek until you find him within your ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be ſo far as we can, like unto God, and out of the real ſenſe of this likeneſs in our ſelves, to love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him. This is the true and the higheſt Worſhip, Man can exhibite to his Maker.</p>
               <p>And to be pure in this of Religion, our Will is alſo requiſite, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we throughly conſent to be in due moderation and rule over all the joys and pleaſures of our Members, to bear a ſtrict hand or watchful eye over their enticements. To have ſuch a firm and loyal affection to Righteouſneſs or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us, that pain of body, profit or riches, and the pleaſures of the <hi>Animal</hi> life, ſhall not work us from it, or abate it in us. Alſo, it being a part of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101495:56"/>we muſt ſee that our Bodies and lower Faculties of mind, be not only uncorrupted, but meet for God's Spirit to dwell in, and act in, by enlightning, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and animating of us to inward duties of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Such Religion as I have here, in part, deſcribed, where it is conſented unto and prevalent, putteth an end to all ſquabbles about Forms or Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Religion; for it brings us to God in Chriſt: (I ſay, in Chriſt, for now we are Sinners, when we mention God it is alwaies to be in him,) where we ſee and enjoy, what makes Terrene things ſo cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us, as we are (by him) crucified to them. Biſhopricks, and Ornaments or Splendor in a Church; Praying with, or without a Form; more or leſs pure Adminiſtration, are all dead-things to us, unleſs as they be made to ſubſerve Piety or Charity. <hi>Let us then exalt that life, that hath lain dead and buried for theſe many Ages under a vaſt heap of Humane Inventions, uſeleſs and cumberſom Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and unpeaceable Opinions: not at all doubting, but that if the Life of Chriſt were once awakened in the World; he that cloaths the Lillies of the field, and adorns the Birds with their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral comely and orderly diſpoſed Colours, will not be wanting to ſuch a Church, as hath the principle of life in it ſelf; but that it will grow up into ſuch an external form and comlineſs in all points, as moſt befits, and are the moſt proper reſults of thoſe vital operations in it. Whenas the beſt Externals without theſe, are but as the skin of an Animal, ſtuffed with Wool or Straw,</hi> ſaith an excellent Doctor<note n="†" place="margin">H.

               <p n="3">(3) Be affectionate and conſtant in Prayer to God; as for what I have ſaid in the preceding Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and for all other good; ſo eſpecially, that

               <p n="4">(4) Avoid all prejudice againſt ought of the Creation of God, <hi>i.e.</hi> deſpiſe no man, nor enter into diſſatisfaction, ſo as to bar your obſerving what of God is in him, or your hope of good from him, or your acceptance of it when it cometh. Be made up of perfect kindneſs to each other, and of good-will and hope to the worſt of men. Be not baſe of diſpoſition, infuſing hatred or variance ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly into any; not Reproachers of others, nor boaſters or exalters of ſelf; not inventors or carriers of Stories, which diſparage or bear ill to any, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Rulers, and to the Government you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Remember what <hi>Noah</hi>'s Son <hi>Cham</hi> did, and received therefore; and the commendable practice of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> contrary thereunto.</p>
               <p>Rulers alſo ought ſo to be, and do unto their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>Behold, God is mighty, and deſpiſeth not any,</hi>

Did not he that made me in the womb, make him? and did not one faſhion us in the womb?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accept what is good, and what is truth from the worſt of Enemies, or meaneſt of Men. Conſider what is ſaid, &amp;c. rather than him who ſpeaketh, or the times paſt, when the like hath been ſpoken, be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101495:57"/>it 40 to 48, &amp;c. what ſpeech at one time is Treaſon or Sedition, may at another be Loyal and neceſſary duty; becauſe what was falſly ſaid in 42, &amp;c. may be truly ſaid now; and what is falſly ſaid now, might have been truly ſaid then.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Anno</hi> 1647, (though I was then very young,) I have not altered my ſenſe of things done before or after; but I am (God be thanked) better affected towards Perſons. I heretofore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held men only in their Infirmities, in their Sins and diſtances from be; but now I look on them as they be in the formation of God, by which I keep more abundant Peace, have avoided many Errors, recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſundry Miſtakes, and eſcaped out of divers ſnares and luſts, eſpecially that of Ill-will, than which there is no greater corruption, or torment, incident to humane Nature. Hereby alſo I have long enjoyed a comfortable and advantagious Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with thoſe I formerly hated, as it were, or diſ-eſteemed; ſome, becauſe they countenanced the Republicans; others, becauſe differing from me in Opinions, in leſſer Doctrines, or in Church Form or Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>In theſe Four, which I term the <hi>General Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> I have repreſented to you things proper to a Creature, to whom God communicates of his own Nature, ſo far as it is capable of receiving it; and of his aſſiſtances and grace, ſo far as its need requireth. It therefore is of moſt import to us, that we give all diligence thus to be.</p>
               <p>The next in order, are the Directions more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. While I was forming of them, there occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to my ſight an excellent diſcourſe of the <hi>Love of God</hi> and <hi>our Neighbour.</hi> The Author is he, who
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101495:58"/>in one Sermon, upon <hi>Bounty to the Poor,</hi> ſhut up the Spittle, <hi>i.e.</hi> left nothing for others to ſay there after him on that Argument, but what he had ſpoken better before them. It is the late Doctor <hi>Iſaac Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> to whom I refer thee for what remains unſaid here, as I had alſo done for that already ſpoken, had not my beginning and intentions taken Air, ſo as to fall into Circumſtances, whence I could not well retrieve them from being made ſo publick, as now they are like to be.</p>
               <p>Having thus far done ſo well as I can, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to where better is for you, I ſhall ſoon diſmiſs you, after I have given you a taſte of <hi>Bathynous</hi>'s skill on the <hi>Theorbo.</hi> A ſolemn Leſſon on which I find to be a very compoſing thing.

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>Speak, O Man, the ſenſe of Conſcience; Is not this better than ſquabbling about Ceremonies, (be it for or againſt them,) or then long and eager Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings about the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? The more men grow in Grace, or Divine and Manly knowledge, the greater ſight and reliſh have they of ſubſtantial Goodneſs: And it being that <hi>Good Part,</hi> ſhall never be taken from the ſincere chooſer of it. Whereas on the contrary, The Good Man, whether he will or no, very oft loſeth the aforeſaid <hi>Jus Divinum</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>I have no goodneſs to boaſt of; and that I have ſo little to do otherwiſe with it, is my reproach and grief: But further degrees of light (by the mercy of God in Chriſt) I have ſince <hi>Anno</hi> 1653; before which, though I was young, my mind was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for Salvation. <hi>Presbytery</hi> being next me, (<hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was withdrawn before I could know any thing,) and my Education thereto directing, I ſoon grew hot for them againſt the Army, and all that then were <hi>Separatists,</hi> (the <hi>Independents</hi> not excepted) which was inflan ed by our Provincials ſending forth their <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:101495:59"/>Which miſſion of theirs occaſioned a new appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a pretence to <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> elſewere, it was that of the Excellent Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations concerning the <hi>Divine Right of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</hi> Though this Great Man was then (as ever ſince) a Stranger to me; yet I went, (as I had before done our own) to read his: by which I found the Engliſh <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; but <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> in neither. And how <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy</hi> comes to have better pretence than theſe had thereunto, I never yet ſaw. What (in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) bid faireſt of any for it, was the <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and ſome other Counties, their <hi>Agreements;</hi> the firſt publiſhed by the much to be valued and Pious Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Yet in theſe it was not the <hi>Form,</hi> ſo much as their Agreement to <hi>bear</hi> with each other, and to <hi>Love;</hi> together with that of <hi>Perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, &amp;c.</hi> Upon the whole, as I then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſo do I ſtill, that theſe various Pretenders, (though on all ſides very good Men) are vain in their pretence to a Divine Right in their different Forms. God hath left the matter undetermined, and ſo ought it to remain, until he ſhall pleaſe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reveal or ſettle in this Affair. <hi>Be not wiſe above what is written, nor religious overmuch,</hi> is Divine Counſel. I will not tranſcribe it again, but I pray thee go back to <hi>page</hi> 75, and read the words of Doctor <hi>More,</hi> there inſerted, which ſhew us where <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is, and when we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee it amongſt us; it will never be found in <hi>Prelacy, Presbytery, Independancy,</hi> or in other more ſeparate (but leſs charitable) Form amongſt us; in that the things which conſtitute theſe, (ſo as we call them,) are too ſmall, and are too capable of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101495:60"/>being wrought to gender Striſe; for to deſerve that worthy name <hi>Divine Ordination,</hi> (or Right) of Government over God's Church. We ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expect to find it in what God and the Law of Creation in Man ſaith, is Great, and which cannot be wrought to any ill purpoſes; becauſe it can never be in any Church or Society, but will bar againſt it, and will purge or purifie from it, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally will put away all the ſorts of Uncharitableneſs, <hi>Hatred,</hi>

               <hi>Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Revilings, and ſuch like:</hi> and conſtitute in their ſtead, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit; Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Faith,</hi> (i.e. Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,) <hi>Meekneſs, Temperance; againſt ſuch there is no Law; i.e.</hi> Be we never ſo ſtrict and zealous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of other Laws, that can never engage any of us to neglect theſe; as many of us that pretend to be all for Order, or that maintain the neceſſity of pure Adminiſtration, are yet found to do, behaving themſelves ſo carnally in their Religion, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all other Chriſtians ſo bitterly, as if they thought that the Goſpel did as much countenance their Earthlineſs and their perſecuting others, as it doth countenance or oblige, in their Opinion, to thoſe Ceremonies or forms of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith,</hi> (or to which) <hi>Chriſt hath made</hi> us <hi>free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of Bondage.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to you, (as my Opinion,) that if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Church Order, and pure Adminiſtration of Ordinances, for Juſtification; or have ſuch opinion of them, and practice thereon, as I have noted; Chriſt ſhall ſtand you in no ſtead: For though you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101495:60"/>ſhould at laſt be found thoſe who have <hi>eaten and drunk in his preſence,</hi> in form as he would have you; and <hi>have in his Name,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> by his power, or to his glory) <hi>done many wonderful works;</hi> yet being without <hi>Charity,</hi> theſe, and Chriſt alſo, ſhall profit you nothing. Himſelf hath ſaid, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 7.23. When ſuch like is pleaded, <hi>Then will I profeſs unto them</hi> (ſaying,) <hi>I never knew you, depart from me, ye that work Iniquity.</hi> One work of which then to be mentioned, himſelf hath expreſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41, 42, 43, 45. which you will find to be the neglect of <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore conjure you, by all thoſe benefits which are afforded us in Chriſt; by the great joy and pleaſure there is in loving one another; and other advantages thence iſſuing to us, and to our Nation, (of which I have diſcourſed,) that you love one another mutually; having, as it were, the ſame Souls, and ſo Affections and Deſigns, all ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking care for this ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Or in the words of St. <hi>Paul, Coloſſ.</hi> 3. ver. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Put on therefore, (as the elect of God, holy and Beloved,) bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man hath a quarrel against any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo do ye. And above all theſe things, put on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is the Bond of perfectneſs. And let the Peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which alſo you are called in one body, and be ye thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which, we ſhall be as the pictures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of God, prized and valued by him; we ſhall ſhew his Spirit hath ſanctified us, and is given unto us; and by the moſt excellent Bond, we ſhall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101495:61"/>be united indiſſolubly one to another, and tyed to the exerciſe of all Graces; not only as our duty, but delight.</p>
            <p>We ſhall hereby be perfectly skilled in all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and perfecting knowledge, particularly the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Love of Chriſt, the knowledge of which is a Science of great concernment to us, far beyond all other Sciences; for hereby our hearts will be enflamed with Love to God; will be fortified againſt temptation to evil, and will be filled with the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which are moſt Divine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of Peace,</hi> (or which delighteth in the Peace and Unity of Chriſtians,) <hi>that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepheard of the Sheep, through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will; working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom, with the Father, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, three Subſiſtences or Perſons, and but one God, be glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p n="1">(1) That I have ſtarted many things; but have not purſued them as I ought.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That I have inſiſted too little on the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of things, <hi>i. e.</hi> as Divines are wont to ſay, <hi>The Doctrinal part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1) I intended to have delivered my whole mind in two or three Sheets, to make it as little labour to me, and charge to others, as I could.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) I conceive, that they who (under God) are to help us, do fully underſtand the matters I do here only point to: So that it may be here, if ever, ſaid, <hi>A word is enough to the Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) I more doubt the Rectitude of the Will, in applying, or chooſing unto Practice, than the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Meaneſt to underſtand the things I have propoſed unto.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) The Nature of ſome things required my ſtop to farther proceedure into them; and others are expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated or fully ſtated already by ſome of greateſt comprehenſion and ability in our Church. In ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the late excellent Biſhop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> out of which I took
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101495:62"/>one part of the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> pag. 31. and <hi>Iſaac Barrow, D.

            <p n="5">(5) Which is enough alone; I have not the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or leaſure of other men, and do reach (in great part) my deſign, if I hereby excite ſome of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be doing, that ſo it may be well done.</p>

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Pair of Extreams in our Church, may ſee their Sin, and their Recovery from it; by what I have wrote in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>third Chapters.</hi> Provided they afford them more thoughts, (as they ought, if they will give any,) than I have given words to them.</p>
            <p>The like may I ſay to the Pair of Extreams in our State. For thereby men may ſee their ſtation in this Kingdom, the Conſtitution they are under, and their duty therein; part of which is to be <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Constant</hi> thereunto. King-Flatterers, and Republicans, or Self-Deſigners, know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo; and a Prince needs no more to find them out, than his own Obſervation of them in their daily mean towards his Perſon or Government. To the latter more eſpecially, in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) In Suggeſtions to a <hi>Variation</hi> in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Wherein the Prince is already Supream, and unto which he hath ſworn Adheſion.</p>
            <p n="2">

(2) In Propoſals to <hi>Things leſs acceptable</hi> to his People; and which the King cannot but ſee, (if he looks into any thing,) are not <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the <hi>Government,</hi> or his <hi>true Greatneſs</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>Theſe two (or ſuch) are alwaies Caſts of the Office of the <hi>Flatterer</hi> or <hi>Leveller</hi> in his Kingdom: So that a more particular account of this matter would have been as too tedious, ſo almoſt needleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sincere Obedience to God, and Charity,</hi> or, as I have ſaid, <hi>Doing our own Buſineſs,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> have Natural and Moral tendancy to Knowledge and Wiſdom, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the ſeeing, and to the well-managing of all things ſo, that he who is Upright ſhall not fail of Science, requiſite to the knowing and doing of his duty in the ſtation God hath ſet him. He hath <hi>Infallibility</hi> nearer, or more ſecured (in God's Promiſes) to him, than the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Conclave</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> have, they being not ſo good Men.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſo far as any one propoſeth to <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> he doth propoſe as to all Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (as hath been ſaid,) ſo unto all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlary to cure all Maladies: For Vertue in the Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and Fruit being of the ſame nature with that in the Root; Peace, and every thing proſperous or truly deſirable, thence muſt come. Contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is <hi>Sin,</hi> of which St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own hearts lust, and enticed. Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin; and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi> Moſt fully to this purpoſe is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>The Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own waies: and a Good-man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101495:63"/>
In ſhort, Men muſt have, and Nations will find, as they are corrupted and lapſed, or as they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and renewed by Grace. I will conclude with the words of St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> Which is moſt true of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Societies of Men.</p>
            <p>Now, of <hi>Obedience to God,</hi> of vigour or ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therein, and of <hi>Love,</hi> I have ſpoken; though little, yet I hope what may be underſtood, and what a good Heart will improve to every needful purpoſe, in his Converſe with God or Man.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Antidoter,</hi> or any for him, be diſpleaſed at me, I will not be overcome of that Evil; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to overcome Evil with Good. That Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor being in his Writing (as I conceived in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in a Spirit very unbecoming an humble and peaceable Chriſtian; and ſeeming like One who had received, as moſt ſavoury, paſt applauſe for Wit. I was inclined to give him a Call to better things, and I took the Paragraph I remark on, rather than other, becauſe I am Morally certain it his peculiar: If after all I diſpleaſe Men, <hi>My rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of my Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; not with fleſhly wiſdom, but</hi> (as I hope) <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> I have herein had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Men, and more abundantly with them of my own Nation.</p>
            <p>Though I have been large on the uſefulneſs of Good Laws, yet leſs is ſaid than the importance of that, to the King's and to the Nations future proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, doth require; it appears to me to be the <hi>Thing of our Peace,</hi> and the proper Buſineſs of this <hi>Day.</hi> God Almighty incline our Parliament (when met)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101495:63"/>thereunto! I cannot imagine any ſhould ſuppoſe ought of difficulty will attend the performance, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the intereſt of every true Proteſtant it ſhould be done; and nothing more than the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing of ſomething, or the correcting of other, which is already our Law, is deſired. But if any, (who be in deſign) by direct oppoſition, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting <hi>Lions</hi> in the way, ſhould diſcourage the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or make it difficult, I hope the King's and the Nations need will animate and inſpire the <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> thereunto. Were I a private Deſigner, or one who had been, and would be again, a great Miniſter of State, I ſhould preſs with moſt vigour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Perſons. But whilſt no other than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and laſting Proſperity is my Object, I muſt be <hi>moſt</hi> for Laws; and I cannot but wiſh the <hi>Three Eſtates,</hi> would give them to us, whereby our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and theirs, may happily experiment their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and prudent regard to them.</p>
            <p>No man ought to preſume our King againſt this. His Temper, as Title, is gracious, ſo that no Predeceſſor therein (as we are to ſuppoſe) exceeds him. No not the Excellent Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who when her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament began to damn ſome Patents ſhe had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſent immediately to the Commons to excuſe her not knowing them to be Illegal, and with the Excuſe ſent all her Patents; whereby at once they diſſolved (as I underſtand) above forty. Alſo, ſhe farther ſignified ſuch reſpect to Laws, and ſenſe of her own and her Peoples benefit in them, ſo as to give ſevere Reprehenſion to the greateſt Counſellors or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for adviſing or permitting, at any time, ought againſt or beſide Law. It is as undutiful to the King, as Treacherous to the People, for any Commoner to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101495:64"/>ſay, or to ſuggeſt, that a Propoſal founded on Law, is too great a point to be gained, or too high or too ungrateful to be inſiſted upon; be it that of <hi>Levying Money</hi> on the Subject without <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or that reſpecting the <hi>Proroguing</hi> or <hi>Adjourning Parliaments,</hi> when neceſſary matters of <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Grievance</hi> are before them, which cannot elſewhere be provided for, or the like; becauſe by them the true Prince is both ſecure and mighty.</p>
            <p>This, Flatterers or Republicans, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe who keep Poor (by cheating,) or thoſe who are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Kings, know; therefore will be reporting ſuch Laws to be <hi>Chains,</hi> or <hi>Fetters of Iron</hi> to Princes: whereas in truth they are ſo only to themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> to their Roguery, or to their Avarice; for when they ſee they muſt be honeſt, they leſs covet to be in Places.</p>
            <p>Is it not, as neceſſary, ſo moſt orderly to give, or to ſecure to us, as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> a <hi>Being</hi> before a <hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being?</hi> We may, through the too ſoon, or the too far or too paſſionate purſuit of Perſons, omit to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, or may further endanger the former; whereby the latter, though the Point greatly deſired be gained, may prove of ſhort continuance with us.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Perſon aimed at be the higheſt Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Subject in a Kingdom, will not the Attempt be difficult, and the event very uncertain? May not motion herein, through <hi>Errour</hi> or through <hi>Fear</hi> in the Agents, prove fatal to the Nation? For if his removal, or that of ſome other, be deemed fuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent alone to cure, the gaining it will caſt them into a golden Dream, or into Slumber, ſo as not to care or to provide for other neceſſaries. And if ſuch difficulty appear, as cometh near unto deſpair of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101495:64"/>ſucceſs, may not the fear of his Power, (ſhould he eſcape,) or for gaining the Point, or their Perſonal Security in future; tempt them to grant what may prove more noxious to the whole?</p>
            <p>A Kingdom, with no Sword drawn, may (through heat or conteſt) be, as it were, in a ſtate of War. The trueſt Wiſdom or Policy then, is, to gain the Poſts firſt which may be gained, and that may ſerve to defend againſt any, be he Friend, (who may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Foe,) or be he Enemy. And in that they be Laws, it is the more requiſite to gain them, that the People may have a Sovereign Fort-Royal to retreat unto at preſent, in caſe the Mighty Subject prove too ſtrong for them, and to defend themſelves in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if it happen ſo that he doth Rule over them.</p>
            <p>I deſire to be underſtood in this, and in every other part of my Book, &amp;c. propoſing with Humble, with Dutiful and Loyal Submiſſion to the Wiſdom and Authority of this Nation: more eſpecially when aſſembled in Parliament: if other Method or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than I have propoſed to, be by them thought more conducive to our Recovery or Settlement, I oppoſe not. That I ſhall do, will be to pray, That <hi>God Almighty and moſt Gracious, would guide and ſucceed their Endeavours: ſo that Glory may be to God, that Peace may be in our Land, and Good-will among Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude with this Advertiſement, That by his Majeſties Gracious Declaration about matters Eccleſiaſtical, which I mention in the <hi>Preface,</hi> and elſewhere in this Book, I intend <hi>that</hi> he put forth in the <hi>13th</hi> of his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1661, and no other; for which (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith) the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> gave him publick Thanks.</p>

Although in my whole Diſcourſe I have had <hi>London</hi> in my thoughts, yet I ſhall in the cloſe of this <hi>Postſcript,</hi> offer ſomewhat more particular to that City;

                  <item>(1) By way of remark on her preſent State.</item>
                  <item>(2) By way of Advice for future.</item>

            <p>The former, as it now is within her ſelf, ſeems nearer, than for ſome preceding years it hath been, unto its <hi>Own Buſineſs and Love.</hi> I will not, by mention of the turnings aſide it hath made or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſince 1660, diſturb its acceſſions thereunto. But to <hi>lift up the feeble knees,</hi> will point at the <hi>door of Hope in the Valley of Achor;</hi> namely, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in deſire, that their Petition for the ſitting of the Parliament might be preſented to our King. And the late Elections they have made into places of Rule, and into places of Truſt; in which, not the Perſons Choſen (the Unchoſen being not leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,) but the Temper, the Principles or Ends of the <hi>Electors,</hi> in Chooſing, (I mean the determining part of them) are the Objects of my mind. Who therein were, as moſt united: ſo</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Moſt affectionate and loyal to the Perſon and Government of his Majeſty, in that it was to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> his being led into an Opinion, That his great City may be brought to any Novelty or Change; than which, no Opinion is more pernicious to him and to his Government, at this time.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) To <hi>Retrieve</hi> the ancient Order and Beauty of Upper and Lower Form in <hi>One</hi> School, which <hi>Bench</hi> Uſurpation had well nigh made <hi>Two;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preparing the City, either to forget that it had but one Maſter, or to be as if they had none, in diſorder and ſquabble.</p>

            <p n="4">(4) To ſix all mens Faith in this, That <hi>London</hi> is now reſolved to be for God, for the King, for the Brotherhood; and will not be cheated again by Raſcals or Levellers, <hi>i. e.</hi> will meddle no more with Men given to Change, or to Deceit.</p>
            <p>My humble Advice to them is, To be looking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, leſt any <hi>Root of Bitterneſs</hi> be ſpringing up in them: In ſpecial, that of <hi>Revenge</hi> or <hi>Ill-will.</hi> Alſo, that of being brought to one extream by (or in) oppoſition to the other, which men cunning in Craft, lay wait to deceive them into. Againſt all which, or other miſchiefs, no better ſecurity than Uprightneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we in every thing perform to each other, as plain-hearted or honeſt men. As thoſe who have made our Neighbour, our very Self, and the Publick Good preferrable to our Private.
